      "I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19.\n",
      "It just keeps getting better...  I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved.  The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that.  It actually makes good sense.)...\n",
      "\n",
      "So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification.  The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week.\n",

      "\n",

      "I have been very fortunate.  People in my church have been bringing me food.  I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved.\n",
      "I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me.  I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well.\n",

      "You are right.  I am definitely not going to sit and pout.  I am just a bit frustrated with the system.\n",
      "I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job.  Because this is an \"at will\" state, he can terminate me without cause.  Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not put it past him.  Sadly.  But I have taken the attitude that if it does occur, there is nothing I can do to change the situation.  I would simply pursue a charge against him for wrongful termination, and seek a new job.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may not win the suit, but I would definitely file one.  In 2000, I had an employer fire me without cause.  I sued and won that time.  Not only did they have to pay me back wages for the 90 days that the investigation took place, which was no minor sum, \n",
      " \n",
      "they were found to be guilty, so the judge granted me my wages based on the average of 80 hour weeks I had been working, all my vacation time, plus the overtime I would have received, holiday pay, and then to put a nice bow on that gift, he awarded me 5000 dollars in damages because the old company lied and said I had broken the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "My current employer actually knows this happened, because years ago we discussed it, and I showed him the award letter from the Department of Labor and Training, itemizing the judge's findings and the awards.\n",

      "\n",
      "That's not an easy question to answer. He treats me very well. Always has. And he is frantically trying to accomodate me, now htat I know.\n",

      "\n",
      "MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six.\n",

      "It was probably gradual, but it seemed like all of a sudden at the end.\n",
      "Pegging is when she puts on a strap on and pleasures me from behind.  It is definitely a niche fetish.\n",
      "The biggest disagreement was that she wanted to start pegging other guys, and I told her no way, we did not agree to that arrangement.\n",
      "No I am a male.  But please don't judge me, I am very fragile right now.\n",
      "I really miss her a lot, I would let her peg those other guys if she wanted to, I just need to get her back in my life.  I told her I would give her as many rimjobs that she requested.\n",
      "There were other women and men that she would bring home for us to have threesomes with.  It made me feel like she was in power.\n",
      "Very solid like a rock.  I feel like you are mocking me now.  Are you a man or woman?\n",

      "Exactly, when it gets quiet it gets suspicious XD Right now my little girl has her woody doll and bo peep doll making them kiss while she watches sherk lol. My 8 years old is engrossed in his cellphone. \n",
      "No my little ones stay in the room around me. They feel insecure since their father walked out on us. So they tend to stick as close to me as possible lately.\n",

      "Yes he tells me it’s just in my head and I could just go out with him, but he drinks then to much so I do not like going out with him\n",
      "Just when he goes out I do not go with him I do not drink and drive \n",
      "And he hangs with some obnoxious people\n",
      "He would go to sleep , and then he thinks I am crazy he says we are no kids anymore that need to go on a date we are married \n",
      "I want that but I doubt he will talk he tells me he has no problems I have them, and all it does is I doubt myself\n",

      "Yes, my family is scattered all over the country, like Seattle, Georgia, PA.  I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though.\n",
      "No.  My nearby friends all went away for the holidays.  I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself.\n",
      "I'm teaching myself the piano.  I'm also teaching myself  how to work a stenography machine for possible future employment as a stenographer.  I also like to read novels.\n",
      "Yeah, it's pretty cool.  For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then \"Did there come a time\" will appear in English on my machine's  LCD screen.\n",
      "Each stenographer has their own \"Personal Dictionary\" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno.  This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi.  Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently.\n",
      "Yes, exactly!  And it's very important to back up your personal dictionary to the cloud or a seperate drive so that you don't lose it in a hard-drive crash.  A lot of work goes into creating that dictionary!  No, it's happened before, being along for the holidays; but you've helped to cheer me up, so thanks!\n",
      "You have, thanks!  Did you do anything special?\n",
      "I will do that - you too.  Thanks, again...\n",

      "\n",
      "I was trying to stop the fight, I just said bit loud , \"Stop  all this  nonsense at my place.\" Then they all started backfiring me. \n",

I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months. I have already worked in this position for 7 months. \n",
      "\n",
      "Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months. I felt lied to and the micromanaging and high turn overstaff due to my supervisor has me on that same boat now. I feel like my only option is to quit. HR was the one who delivered the transfer denial. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am thoroughly disappointed, I have applied for a few local security job sites in my area that have had some interest in my resume. I figure I will leave the hospital since I was lied and I can only see this being the trend with this department. They keep their good workers and let the low skilled workers transfer out or they just quit. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have a six page paper of grievances for HR and a full unscripted transparent experience as an employer with details and dates of these frustrations. I know it will not go anywhere since their policy states that an employee must work six months from when they take a new position within the company. I went from a housekeep to a housekeeper technician (scrub walls and take curtains down and clean contact rooms). \n",

I went to school for criminal justice and the hospital would have helped me obtain my bachelors if I worked for them after completing it, I had to work there for a year in order to get their help. I was looking forward to this opportunity, but now I am just to bitter to work there at this point.  I loved what we stand for value wise, but \n",

      "\n",
      "She was old, blind and was getting dog dementia. I had to have her put to sleep\n",
      "\n",

      "I was doing pretty good then there was this dog in the movie and I just broke down again.\n",

      "\n",
      "yes he wants me to know so that he doesn't feel guilty about it\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.... he said I can do it behind your back without you ever knowing but I would rather be honest with you\n",
      "I told him I don't want that to happen but he offered whatever I wanted no matter the price and all I could think was I just want him to be faithful\n",
      "He told me not to take it personally because it is just lust and that he loves me only\n",
      "Actually, today is our 4th year anniversary\n",

      "We are separated.  She said I was watching too much Buzzr and didn't pay enough attention to her, so she dumped me.\n",
      "We tried to see a counselor.  It did go too well, the counselor took her side on everything, it was very unprofessional.\n",
      "It feels like that way.  Even my parents seem to support her more than me.  I am all alone now watching a Buzzr marathon with no one to truly support me.\n",
      "Has this happened to you before?\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that, I think your boyfriend made a big mistake leaving you, you seem like a very nice and sweet person.\n",
      "That might be true, she really blew it with me, I am a good catch.\n",
      "I agree.  You know, you are very good at this.  Did you end up finding a new boyfriend or husband?\n",
      "Well that is a good success story!  Thank you for the motivation.\n",
      "Yes I will do that.  Thank you for your support.\n",
      "Hi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better\n",

      "Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well.\n",
      "Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough.\n",
      "I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best?\n",
      "I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.\n",
      "Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.\n",
      "Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break\n",
      "I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe.\n",
      "I have 6 classes\n",
      "Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you!\n",

      "\n",
      "That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes because I do not have experience with Turkish men and I am scared of him being controlling and abusive I guess its due to sterotypes i read about and heard\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I agree with u have u met any turkish people?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think its also due to me being hurt before but scared of trying something new giving a new person a chance I have major trust issues\n",

      "Since then, she has stopped taking her medication and is acting out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to have  my mother take her back, but she still didnt want her there. So I sent her to my grandmothers and she turned that side of the family against me.\n",

      "Only once and she was just telling me that I was a horrible person.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "I would hate to see that happen, but Im at my wits end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now my dads side of the family hates me because they say Im \"mean to her\". All I asked her to do was to clean her room and maybe socialize every once in a while. \n",

      "\n",
      "I understand, but I think it would have better than sitting in a dark room all day.\n",

      "Yes, but she denies it whole heartedly. \n",

      "This is why she was taking medication.\n",

      "Yes.  I tried to see if she would let me sleep with other women from the Internet, and she is not allowing it.\n",
      "Yes I would agree with that.  I guess I wanted my cake and be able to eat it too.\n",
      "I am trying to get my wife to spice up our love-making and she is unwilling to do so, and that makes me super sad.\n",
      "Why would we need counseling to spice up a love life?  That should come naturally, is it hard for women to make that change?\n",
      "That is what makes me sad, I know I am the problem.  I am a piece of trash, she is way better than me.    I hate myself.\n",
      "Maybe I have a sex addiction.  I think I watch too much pornography and it gives me weird ideas for sex.\n",
      "Just for me?  I hope I get a male counselor because if it was a female one, I would probably want to sleep with her.\n",
      "Yes, I can't control my impulses.  I am picturing what you look like now and imagining what we would do together.  I think I have a big problem.\n",
      "I am forty one, fat and married.  I actually prefer heavier ladies, but I get your point.  :)\n",

      "I have a lot of homework and housework, and especially during these difficult times it is hard to get support and feel like I am improving in life\n",
      "It is really stressful and hard to plan out all the things I have to do, and sometimes I get a headache just thinking of it all\n",
      "Yes, and not being able to meet friends or go out much makes it hard to get all my emotions out\n",
      "Do you have any tips on how to deal with headaches or being overly stressed or anxious?\n",
      "So something like going for a run, or watching a funny movie?\n",
      "Thank you for the ideas\n",
      "But what if you get so stressed you can't really think of anything else?\n",
      "Thank you so much, your advice will be really helpful!\n",
      "I think it is fine, but thank you so much for giving me tips\n",

      "\n",
      "What positive are there here?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's ok. pays the bills. But my job is pretty independent.  so i don't even get to meet new people.  I am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day.\n",

      "\n",
      "That sound like something i could give a try.  any other seggestions?\n",

      "Things like this were sudden.  I mean, I never expected her to up and walk out with the kids.\n",
      "The only thing I can think of was that California was getting too expensive and the homeless were taking over LA; that may have spooked her to leave the state.\n",
      "I really don't have any discourse.  The kids are almost 18.  They are twins. Yeah, in her eyes, she seems fed up with the state. She left me for Texas, the state, not the person.\n",
      "I mean, she never mentioned loving, \"Text,\" but the kids are bing into the Dallas Cowboys\n",

      "Hello\n",
      "Kind of angry and disappointed.\n",
      "My friend created a group chat for planning activities and did not include me. She included people who are closer to me than to her. Almost like she is trying to steal my friends.\n",
      "In a way. I was disappointed by the rest of them but mostly angry at her. It almost feels like she wants to be the leader of the group and feels like I am her competition.\n",
      "Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems. Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them.\n",
      "I am a bit of an idealist. I like for everyone to be in harmony, to be nice, supportive, caring, open and honest. I don't know how to move on from this.\n",
      "I talked about it with one friend. He felt bad but what I couldn't understand why he was secretive about the chat too. If he thought we were close why hide stuff?\n",
      "Do you think it is asking too much on my part?\n",
      "Sometimes I question if it is even worth talking to them about it. People often don't want to say what they really think. Instead they just say whatever to avoid confrontation. \n",
      "Oh I know they would. I don't hang out as much as they all do so that is probably why I wasn't included in the chat. But I didn't see the harm of me being in it even if I couldn't make it to most events. I guess it's the secrecy that bothers me. It makes me a bit paranoid about what else do they all know that I don't.\n",
      "I'm very stressed.  Virtual school is so hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've never gotten bad grades before this year.\n",
      "Yes, that is correct.  I need to be in a classroom to really grasp the material, I think.\n",
      "I just want to quit school because I can't seem to do better.\n",
      "I wish I knew how long we would have to be virtual.  I don't think I can last another semester teaching myself from home.\n",
      "Yes, I was always an honors student so this is a huge change for me.   I'm afraid it will reflect on my GPA forever.\n",
      "I tried exercise to see if that would help.  It hasn't really helped because the time I spend exercising I just think I could be studying.\n",
      "I could try deep breathing. Fresh air is hard because we're in the middle of a snow storm!\n",
      "I like to go to a spa when I'm really stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will try the deep breathing more often.  \n",
      "That's a good idea.  Maybe I could make it a reward for a good grade on a test.\n",
      "I think it might too!\n",
      "Hello. Feeling low today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products.\n",
      "\n",
      "I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face-to-face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks. It helps to know that I'm not alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues?\n",
      "Ah, something more casual?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a great idea! I would love to get a care package, actually!\n",
      "Thank you! I will suggest that my organization arrange these. We can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies, or some such.\n",

      "Yes I have emailed every employer where I was interviewed. Also I follow up with every hiring agency I have signed up to.\n",
      "They all suggest to wait for a few months till things are bit normal. They also advice to keep trying.\n",
      "Yes it indeed is\n",
      "It is very difficult to stay home doing nothing, it is very upsetting\n",
      "I have started to paint which I have always enjoyed doing but again when I see others close me work and settled it makes me feel sad that I don't have a job\n",
      "I should try doing that, thanks\n",
      "No issues other than this at the moment. Have you found a new job?\n",
      "Glad to hear, Congratulations!! Hope I find a job soon\n",

      "Yeah, it's pretty tough because the year went really well until the summer. I was hoping for a strong close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes but with the pandemic, people are just doing small work themselves instead of hiring out.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what I've been doing, but it's a lot of running in place trying to generate any income.\n",

      "Yes, I've tried both of those. It's mostly luck based. You just have to hope that enough people get interested to make it work and a lot of wasted effort goes into self-\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I have a lot of coursework but I have no help from from my advisors. A few of my peers feel the same way. Not sure what to do. I don't believe remote learning is helpful in a master program because the professor/advisor are not always available. \n",
      "I tried, but the coursework is difficult and the other solution is tutorials on youtube but there is so much you can do on your own. Plus I have a job as well, so limited hours\n",

I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone. \n",
      "Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male (please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women. \n",

      "\n",
      "Yea, that definitely seems to be part of my problem. I really thought he was different, too. And when he broke up with me, I tried to get him to spend the night with me in a hotel, and I felt so pathetic because I was practically begging for sex\n",

      "\n",
      "Yea, a few things here and there. Nature, let's say. But nature doesn't really give one way or another about you. My friends have a lot of money, though, and none of them are even happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "thats even more saddening\n",
      "\n",
      "Yea, I know, right. I have one friends who has probably about 100k in the bank, and he will complain if he spent 4 cents too much on gas over another gas station.\n",

      "Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though?\n",
      "yes it's all virtual though\n",
      "That is a good idea.  Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things?\n",
      "I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college?\n",
      "okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down?\n",
      "okay but is it normal to be upset?\n",
      "Okay that makes me feel better\n",

      "I should trust my partner more than any random person. \n",
      "But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better?\n",
      "okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. \n",
      "That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. \n",
      "Okay. I will keep that in mind.\n",
      "We are 22. \n",
      "Yes but less over the past few months. \n",
      "That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. \n",
      "He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends. \n",
      "\n",
      "No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. \n",
      "I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. \n",
      "You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? \n",
      "Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. \n",
      "Yes off campus. Same college. \n",
      "I work at a bar part time to support may way through school. \n",

      "I found out I'm losing my job on January 1.\n",
      "No, not due to covid. It's a gig job, much like mturk, but the company is dropping people from my state on that date.\n",
      "I've been looking at other companies, but learning a new system after all these years is difficult.\n",
      "That's true. I've thought about looking into new fields.\n",

      "\n",
      "how did you do it\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually think that is a great idea.  I have never thought of doing that for that specific purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess it makes a lot of sense.  If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities.  Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart.\n",

      "I swear, I can't take these lockdowns anymore.\n",
      "I mean it's one thing to limit capacities in places, but to say we're not allowed to go to our friends' and family's home is just plain ridiculous.  \n",
      "That is a shame. I mean I know people can still do Zoom or Facetime, but I imagine you can related to me in knowing that both of those options are not the same as face to face. \n",
      "I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love. Instead of laughing or jumping with fright in theaters with everyone, we now have to do it with ourselves. Rather than cheering as an audience over a touchdown, it's now a crowd of one. It just feels robotic now. \n",
      "Yeah, but even with the distribution, some people are saying that things won't return to normal till about late spring/early summer. \n",
      "It's certainly maddening.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess, I still think our responce to this was sloppy at best. I mean, lockdown the healthy masses due to a discease with a 99% survival rate? It just doesn't make sense in my book. I'm just glad this silliness will be over soon.\n",

      "Yes. To handle my previous depression I self medicated and ended up going to prison. Made my situation worse. Now trying to adjust but depression is worse having lost job and social stauts\n",
      "Yes, but its a vicious circle. Get blue and find it hard to strive. Unfortunately many jobs require background checks these days. Even Amazon!\n",

      "Yes sometimes. I don't tell them how I feel though. I don't want them to worry about me.\n",
      "I suppose. I just worry that I will make them sad too. It's hard time for everyone.\n",

      "That is true. I believe I have a problem showing vulnerability.\n",
      "I haven't been with my boyfriend that long before the pandemic started so I still have some fears and trust issues. I fear that being weak pushes people away.\n",
      "That is true. I should be brave enough to find out if he will be there when the chips are down. I am going to do it\n",

      "\n",
      "Yeah, I guess you're right. I know you're right. I just haven't felt really in the Christmas spirit this year and I am anxious about everything I can't control. \n",
      "He did have an interview today too, so that is good news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lol - you made me smile. Thanks. I will believe that too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It really did help. Just talking and saying it out loud (or online) helped. Feeling heard helped.\n",
      "I am thankful for your listening to me. It does make a big difference. I am in a better mood. Thank you!\n",
      "Thanks and have a great day!\n",
      "Hello\n",

      "What I should have put in is about my uncle I'd rather talk about that. He passed yesterday to colon cancer\n",
      "I am. I knew he had it but didn't know how bad off he was until they called and told me all his organs were shutting down\n",
      "That is really nice of you to say but sadly he passed last night\n",
      "Yeah it's sad\n",

      "\n",
      "am based on a quota.  I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour.  that's almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse.  If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7-10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast.\n",
      "doesn't feel like it to me.\n",
      "I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn't give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts.....\n",
      "Yes and they always say the same thing.  You need to get your numbers up but it's a catch 22 you can't possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas\n",

      "No, it's not that she is strict. She is disrespectful and a bit of a narcissist\n",
      "Yes, working from home but that doesn't make it less stressful to work. I have to attend zoom meetings with her several times per week and she can pop into any of my classes randomly\n",
      "\n",
      "She does know that but we had a negative interaction once and she's been horrible ever since\n",
      "Yes! She is quick to divert blame away from herself and is not a good supporter of most teachers, except the ones she favors\n",
      "No, she is pretty petty about it. It was actually easier to deal with when we were in school because I could avoid her. But now we have mandatory meetings... I am definitely not one of her favorites\n",
      "\n",
      "1 1/2 years and normally I would change schools but the pandemic has made that harder\n",

      "\n",
      "yes writing has been a huge help for me. i would take your suggestion and begin writing again to feel better. and i have let others read what i wrote and they have said it has helped them get over their depression and helped them understand me more\n",

      "Its too risky to travel.  And with kids you it will be difficult. Besides you never know what will happen so don't want to take risk of travelling.\n",
      "You can't  just stay home all day as you cant go shopping to malls or watch a movie in theatre!! Its so frustrating.\n",
      "It feels like your life has come to a full stop.!!\n",
      "Absolutely there could be other ways where you can  focus you mind into like gardening was my hobby which I had started again during this pandemic.\n",
      "Not really but I like watching the flowers bloom and see how my vegetables were growing each day. I loved watching the birds and butterflies around beautiful blooms.\n",
      "That gave me a bit of positivity in life.\n",
      "Yes of course  and it helped me to teach my kids a bit about nature too. They seemed to be interested in gardening also.\n",
      "Yes that was the best way to connect with nature . They could just pluck out the fruits from plants and eat them right away which they had not done for quite long time. They surely had fun.\n",

      "Do you think I should forgive her?\n",

      "It comes and goes in waves. Sometimes I feel strong and other times I feel so weak.\n",
      "Yes. That is true, but it can be so overwhelming at times.\n",
      "What are some things that you do to feel better?\n",
      "I also journal. It helps sometimes. But I can't stop thinking about my family and how hard this is on them also.\n",
      "Yes. They are very supportive. That is one of the things that make me so sad. I hate the thought that this disease may take me away from them.\n",

      "We were together for over a year but we got serious quickly. At least that's what it seemed like because he talked marriage.\n",

      "\n",

      "Yes it has. We are in different countries and his ex is in the same country as him.\n",

      "yea that's right. It's weighing heavy on my mind at the moment\n",
      "\n",
      "yes, the older I get the worse the feeling is. I didn't used to hate birthdays when I was younger\n",
      "Yes, those are hard. My 30th was difficult. Society has so many wrong ideas of where people need to be, and it just doesn't apply to me. I'm so different from normal people.\n",
      "\n",
      "maybe, but being autistic, even average achievements are hard for me. I have to work so hard just to be average\n",
      "\n",
      "May I ask, how did you deal with your own birthday depression? Maybe I can learn from you\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what I've been thinking about too. It probably doesn't exist, but society would have us believe otherwise\n",
      "\n",
      "Yep, it sure is. I figure people stop caring that much when they get older\n",
      "\n",
      "I've already stopped caring what people younger than me think. They just seem so young to me\n",
      "\n",
      "yea, it's just hard when I struggle so much with employment. My issues really keep me from succeeding in jobs\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, there are things I can do; but they don't seem to help me with anything important in life, if you know what I mean\n",
      "\n",
      "I was forced into therapy as a young person. I think it put me off seeking professional help because I hated the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I talk to other autistic people in support groups online\n",

      "hello, how're you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm feeling rather sad. I used to have a very close-knit group of friends, basically my best friends. We would talk all the time, hang out together, and basically just do everything together. Because of Covid, I've had to stay in my house and basically not associate with anyone else. My friends don't even try to talk to me anymore. I understand that life goes on without me, but they could at least try. \n",
      "\n",
      "They never even offered to wear a mask around me. They would make fun of me when I wore a mask. They didn't support my decisions when I was trying to still be a part of the group while also protecting my family (since they are all high risk)\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Sure they've tried to stay in touch but it's always me starting the conversation. Or if they start it, it only involves \"hi how're you, good how're you,\" and then the conversation ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. They say that because I'm not hanging out with them physically, it's hard. They also say that I don't put effort into conversations when I feel like I am the only one putting in effort (which I have stated and they have said I don't).\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes this is correct. \n",
      "Thank you. I just don't know what to do in this situation. I don't want to keep reaching out when I don't feel like they actually want to keep in contact with me. I know we could still get along well, but it's hard when I'm the only one to make the effort. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have very few that have similar thoughts as me that I have tried to reach out to. But most of them have their own lives, boyfriends/girlfriends, and things they do. Mostly everyone seems to be hanging out with people which leaves me physically left out. \n",

      "\n",
      "Honestly, I'm okay. I have my family and other things to occupy my time. It's just hard finding other friends right now in the times we're living in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to go actually practice on a field right now because 1.) It's rather cold outside 2.) I have to wear a mask 3.) I'd only shoot on goal, waste gas, and a good chunk of time. But when I have other people it is fun. I haven't tried that because where would I even go? I don't want to be desperate either ya know?\n",

      "Well, one time he got drunk and kept calling me ugly in a joking way while we were at a party with a group of new ppl. He seems to have an agenda to embarass me.\n",

      "What should I do to still be friends with her? I don't know what to do anymore!\n",
      "Yes. I even texted her and called her. She opened my messages but didn't respond and she even ignored my calls. \n",
      "Its been more than 3 days and I have given her time. I don't think I can wait longer. I might loose her.\n",
      "Due to the COVID cases right now I am trying to not risk the safety of others and myself. I don't know that going up to her house would be the best option at this moment :(\n",
      "We have been friends for so many years and I do not know why she is acting like that. I do not want to loose this precious friendship. \n",

      "i mean no one has specifically said anything to me that was negative, but suddenly i feel like people are avoiding me. we used to hang out in the living room all the time and we would eat these big meals, but yesterday i came home and they were all cooking with my ex. they said they made enough for me but it seemed like such an after thought\n",
      "\n",
      "you mean if we DID speak?\n",
      "i think i just want to know that we're all still friends, i guess. I want our house to feel like home, again.\n",

      "I don't know... I know my friends would be supportive. But then I feel like it's selfish of me to bring people down, when this whole year has been a downer for so many of us.\n",
      "Maybe, but I wouldn't mind that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing is that my mom had died in January, the same year. So everyone has already dealt with me grieving all year. I don't want to just be associated with sadness for everyone.\n",

      "Hmm, I didn't know that. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist through my medical insurance. I live in sort of rural Oregon, but maybe I could get help by text or video...\n",
      "The issue is finding someone you click with. I think that's hard. I'm not sure my doctor could do much for me - she's already got me on the waiting list for therapy through her organization.\n",
      "If it wasn't for COVID, I'd probably look into support groups...\n",
      "Oh yeah? Can you recommend anywhere to start?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. I also just moved to a new state, and don't really know anyone yet. It's a hard time for making new connections.\n",

      "\n",
      "Very weird.  I am one of the oldest men there and I am always expected to jump in and do work that is manual labor.  Very frustrating to see someone else just sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "It really would not be my place, it would be up to my boss.  He obviously said nothing.  \n",
      "I keep hoping that one of the upper management team will walk by one day and see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely not being fair across the board, in my eyes.\n",
      "You're probably correct.  I may feel better just getting it out, even if the situation does not change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, that helps hearing that from someone.  \n",
      "Seriously, over two years.  True\n",
      "I never have, I just looked at him like are you for real when he asked me if the guy was sleeping the one day.  I had to bite my tongue not to say, yes, and he does it every day!\n",
      "Well thank you for letting me get this out.  I appreciate the advice and I will definitely think over talking with my boss.  Have a good night!\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "\n",
      "Really bad. My 10 year marriage is failing. Things have not gotten better.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the thing. Nothing really happened. No cheating, drugs, or abuse. I suppose the euphoria has worn off, and she just doesn't find me interesting anymore.\n",
      "Maybe we haven't done this enough in the past. We both had busy careers. I tried initiating this last year, but without success. Maybe, I was too late. \n",
      "I hope you're right. Do you have other suggestions about how to do so?\n",
      "I think your suggestions are very helpful. A vacation is currently out of the picture due to COVID. I want to try having deep conversations, but I don't know where to start.\n",
      "I think you hit upon something. She is quite hesitant in talking about issues. Do you have any thoughts about marriage counselling? We've never tried that.\n",
      "If my wife is the one having issues with conversations, do you think a male or female therapist/counsellor would be better? I want her to feel comfortable expressing herself.\n",
      "I think that sounds like a safer choice. I was also hoping if you have suggestions for me personally. I am quite depressed and I am having problems getting through the day.\n",
      "Thank you very much for your response. You have been very helpful. Perhaps, one last question - my wife and I have been hiding our problems away from our teen-age son. Do you agree that we should continue to keep it from him?\n",
      "Ok, thanks for all your help again. I feel much better now, and hopefully I will get through this.\n",

      "Oh, not too bad - and you?\n",
      "I'm just getting frustrated with a cousin of mine. I really appreciate her support through stuff like both my parents dying last year, and I'm trying to support her, too...\n",
      "But she'll be set off by completely unpredictable things. I try hard to avoid any possible conflict, but she finds a way to get hurt anyway.\n",
      "We hardly ever talk on the phone, which sometimes would be easier. I just feel like she's so close to losing it all the time, I don't want to seem critical.\n",
      "Only in the sense that she could have a nervous breakdown, or collapse from exhaustion. She's really strong, though.\n",
      "Well, I have asked her about counseling, and she does have a counselor. Her husband won't do joint counseling. A decade ago, I might have talked to her mom about it, but her mom is now frail herself, and her own husband is a lot to handle. I feel protective of my aunt, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost feel like her counselor doesn't do much good for her, but I know there are different styles of therapy... I feel like the therapist just echoes back to her how awful her husband is, etc (he's not really that bad, but they've grown apart). But if I ever say anything like this, she just doesn't speak to me for weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I need to try to approach the topic with her. It would be better in person, but that's not easy now. We live 800 miles apart, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her issues, or the issue of her blowing up over anything I say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Her time is so jam-packed, it's hard. I paid for her to take a vacation up near me. But she had two of her kids with her, so we couldn't really talk. I wish I could just have her to myself for 24 hours - ha. She acts like the kids are in danger with just her husband, which is completely untrue.\n",
      "Well, she has her therapist. I'm not sure what I could really do.\n",
      "Yes.... I think talking to our other cousin about her might be a good place to start.\n",
      "I think it might help... It's one of these things - everyone has so much going on in their own lives... But of course it's also therapeutic to feel like you're helping someone you love. So it might be good for both cousins.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three cousins\n",
      "Yes, I agree... Well, I'll give it a shot.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, problem is that he is extremely fit and stubborn. That could be a solution. Not in his current state though... He would lose his mind. He is a veteran... so. He could lose it.\n",
      "\n",

      "Yes, sure\n",
      "I would say compared to every relationship I have had, this is the best relationship I have been in. Plus we have children involved.\n",
      "I think that after speaking with you, I realize the choice I must make though difficult. And yes we have talked with everyone close with us or connected.\n",
      "I feel like everyone respected both of our wishes as they were different but everyone also offered advice and shared their experiences. Everyone was cooperative.\n",
      "Yes we listened to each other but it was still a more agree to disagree conversation. No over talking or arguments.\n",
      "Yes I have come to understand that we must have those hard conversations rather than avoiding it. Thanks for the talk!\n",
      "I do now that I have talked it through.\n",
      "I'm doing pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yah they are very difficult.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I am alright, how are you doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "I really want to ask how you are doing and what issues you are having, I have done like 5 of these on the supportive side. I have been getting migraines lately which is making my depression worse\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty much my whole adult life, at least 12 years or so\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly have a pretty good handle on the depression, lots of therapy. The migraines are making it hard to get anything done \n",
      "though\n",
      "I am honestly not sure, I have gotten one in my entire life before and 6 in the last month. I dont think that it is stress related\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly not really, things are going well at work and life is actually going well\n",
      "\n",
      "No I am stuck going into work, we are essential enough to stay open\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes honestly covid has definitely been exhausting. masks have been mandatory here for quite some time so I am never without one\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly I wear a mask 8 hours a day and its not a big deal\n",
      "\n",
      "Not much has changed\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes its been surprising, I have talked to my doctor and he suggested I try to document my triggers so I will try to do that\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway I have to get going, You have been very helpful. Have a wonderful day!\n",
      "I am still depressed about losing my job.\n",
      "It's been rough, it was out of the clear blue. I've been looking for a job, then the pandemic hit.\n",
      "Yea, I know, it's not just me. But I do feel alone. I know how they feel.\n",
      "I work in the hospitality industry, at a hotel.  Trust me I've been looking, but so far no luck. Since this pandemic, I'm not sure I want to leave the house. How have you loved one dealt with it?\n",
      "That's good, at least I know there is light at the end of the tunnel. I was thinking at this stage of the game I might have to learn something new in order to get a job. Hopefully, the vaccine will help start to bring things back to normal. Did your friend find a job in the same field?\n",
      ":) Thanks I needed that. I think I might have to reinvent myself also. For sure the pay will be a lot different, it'll be like starting all over again.\n",
      "I sure hope so, fingers crossed. Thankfully, I don't have to work much longer, but since I have been working for so long, I do miss it. I think I miss the people more than anything.    \n",
      "Awww! Thank you I really needed that, you have no idea how much that means to me. A little encouragement goes a long way in these times we are living in. And you are right, I am healthy and I am thankful for that. Eventually, the job will come.\n",
      "Yes, we do need each other more than we know . I have to remind myself, it's not just me going through this. Thank you for your kind words. \n",
      "I hope you do as well. Stay Healthy and be careful. Thank you again for your kind words. And 2021 will be better than 2020!  \n",
      "Hello\n",
      "I am feeling down and scared.\n",
      "The ongoing pandemic and my financial situation. I am unemployed and I don't know when I will be able to get a job.\n",
      "Yes I have been applying but have not gotten any responses. I imagine a lot of people are competing for jobs.\n",
      "I have not been using apps. I use websites and look for jobs there. It is making me feel like I am not qualified enough.\n",
      "I have not contacted a job agency. I don't have experience with them. That is a good idea.\n",
      "Yes I am going to look. It will increase my chances of finding work.\n",
      "It doesn't help that I live with my parents and because I have no work I spend most of my time at home and get into arguments with them.\n",
      "It would probably be good to volunteer to get out of the house. I think I will do that once the pandemic restrictions ease.\n",
      "Can you think of any online volunteering opportunities? You have been very helpful so far.\n",
      "Great. I will try that today. Thank you so much for your help.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. \n",
      "Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me\n",
      "It was a core class and I needed it to graduate \n",
      "\n",
      "That does sound like a good idea. I am just so disappointed I'm not sure if it is worth it. \n",

      "No, I haven't tried that. And I appreciate it, but you have no way of assuring that I am beautiful when you haven't seen me. Beautiness is relative too. Maybe I am dislikeable for my coworkers but pretty for someone else.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yeah, I have. They say that I am either super invested on my school work or that I lack any signs of effort at times.\n",

      "\n",
      "I disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. I don't think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. I was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman I meet.\n",

      "\n",
      "yes, have a friend who I'm very close to , but have noticed she doesn't tell me the truth this days. And not only that she has been distancing as in not calling , always waiting for me to call. I call her about a week ago, but wasn't happy how she dismissed my call within seconds telling me she will call me back only for her not to call till to day. I don 't feel like calling her again.\n",

      "\n",
      "That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why. \n",
      "I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me. \n",

      "\n",
      "No, he loves it! I'm the one who hates it.\n",

      "I tell him, but he just doesn't get it. Or, he says he understands, but then just goes back to talking!\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, he may finally end the talk, but the next time we talk, he will just do it all over again!\n",
      "\n",
      "He will literally talk up to 10 minutes without letting you have a word in. As far as that advice, I have hung up, but he gets extremely offended easily.\n",
      "I'm at my wits end. I tell him all the time. \"You talk too much. You gotta stop talking at me. You gotta give the other person a turn. You gotta respect other's time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I've been friends with him for a long time. He's funny and can have interesting perspectives on things. Also, we have done a lot together in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, yes, I have other friends in conversations who can take turns and understand the concept of time just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't know what to do about this guy in particular. I still want to be his friend, but he just doesn't change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think I should just have a timer that goes off at 1 minute and let it beep in his face if he goes on for too long to train him like a monkey?\n",
      "\n",
      "I just need a method. Talking to him is just not working.\n",
      "He is hard to condition.\n",
      "Yea, but I might be able to slip some humour in there to take the edge off because it is so silly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any other ideas?\n",
      "\n",
      "So your option is to start just doing something else when he is talking? He might get the message in a subtle way?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is true, and it isn't bade advice. Haha! That is funny. Yes, maybe I should find something to carry around with me that I can enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't really like to draw...\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, perhaps I should just use the internet when he starts talking too much. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have a phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "This solves the problem in person, but it doesn't solve the talks over the phone, but it has been 15 minutes now and this has been helpful enough. Thank you for your solutions. You have been very supportive and kind to me\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to take up any more of your time. It has been a good conversation. \n",

      "\n",
      "Yeah, it is good because of the holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to bad, just had a death in the family. Pretty bummed about it because we are a close to our extended family and can't visit one another to grieve\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, we just had a virtual funeral for him and it was painful to watch. We couldn't console those who needed it\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah thats a good way to look at it, the whole family was able to get together in one place and was able participate safely. We also chatted hours afterwards. I did feel better about it\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes it is, I do wish we can meet in person but COVID\n",
      "\n",
      "I do feel better though, this was the best case scenario. Got to meet everyone and say my goodbyes at least.\n",
      "Yeah try to stay safe together and reduce the spread of this diseases. \n",
      "Hopefully the cases start declining, it is not doing well for peoples mental health. Just had a friend die from mental illness. \n",
      "I'm doing alright, I feel my mental health is weakening as time goes by do to zero interaction and remote working. But staying strong and managing. \n",
      "Yeah, thanks for the talk. I feel much better. It is good to talk things talk and get them off of your chest.\n",
      "I am having ongoing depression.\n",
      "I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago.\n",
      "Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family.\n",
      "Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end.\n",
      "I haven't thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad.\n",
      "You're welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal.\n",
      "I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined.\n",
      "Yes, I enjoy taking walks and doing a cardio workout at home.\n",
      "I could communicate more with my family by calling them on the phone, texting, emailing, or talking to them on Zoom.\n",
      "Yes, I think that Zoom and texting would make me feel less depressed.\n",
      "Wanting to stay in bed is keeping me from using these methods. \n",
      "I feel okay about that.\n",
      "Yes, it is worth a try. Thank you for all of your help!\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Goodbye.\n",
      "Hello. How are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just feeling sad and depressed over the breakup that I described above. Hoping for some inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel so betrayed. I was completely caught off guard. Now I don't know what to do with myself.\n",
      "Just this last week. I came home from work early Thursday. I guess I should have texted first so he could get rid of the guy. Or maybe not. Maybe it's better that I found out.\n",
      "We were together almost ten years. Over nine and a half. I had no idea. I don't think the guy is even someone he really cares about. I don't know.\n",
      "Yes that's right, I'd never seen him before.\n",
      "No, it was just the two of us. And two cats. Who are still here with me. There's that at least.\n",
      "Just from home. Self-published author, some online work, stuff like that. He made about as much as I did, I wasn't the sole breadwinner or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it did. There are some fans of his work on social media, and he's on all the popular social media sights. I don't know if he me the guy online or what. There hasn't been anything like this before that I know of. Maybe there was. I trusted him and didn't look at his messages or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, they weren't, I agree there. He took all his devices with him. I can see his stuff from a user point of view, like anyone else in the public could, but nothing of his personal stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, we're over. And it is hard. I'll get past it I suppose. I don't think I could, but I don't really want to anyway at this point. It's not going to help us get back together or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you're right. Just look forward.\n",
      "You're right. Thank you for listening. I feel a little better already. I'll get through this. Me and the cats :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds like a good plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you again. I'm going to go ahead and wrap up the conversation. I'll be okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You too. Take care.\n",
      "Hello...I have never done this before\n",

      "Oh I am just looking to vent. The quarantine has added a lot of anxiety on my end, and I have a hard time coping with the new normal \n",
      "yeah I agree with the sentiment. I like my housemates/friends if we hang out once in a while, or run into each other in the common area a few times a week. Now we are all confined under the same roof all the time \n",
      "If someone doesn't remember to wash dishes, or started smoking that resulted in the whole house smelling. There is only this much I can do \n",
      "I can remind them; but they are likely just saying that they are sorry and continuing doing what they do \n",
      "or if the wall neighbor decided to watch TV really loud very late at night and you can't sleep. I can tolerate it if it is only once in a while, but now we are together all the time\n",
      "yeah they are all polite and willing to acknowledge that there is something to improve on their part. I am sure there are things that I can improve on my end too. IT is just the nature of the quarantine has really upped the anxiety level. \n",
      "I don't feel the option of escaping, changing the scenery a little bit or adjusting emotionally \n",
      "it has also changed the relationship that I have with my housemates/friends. In the past, we have fun together, now it's like we are husband and wives pointing out each other's mistakes \n",
      "yeah that is a good point. I agree with you.\n",
      "Do you have similar experience. I would like to know what you think\n",
      "I will do more of that. I guess we are all making sacrifices and learning how to cope \n",

They have complained and supposedly one of them will be our manager soon.  I have thought about looking for a new job. Covid protocol has kept me from making a move though.\n",
      "Thing is in my industry, aerospace interiors, the competition is cut throat in engineering. I already have to work about 55 hours/week. I do mturk to pay my phone bill (sort of a bet with my wife lol).  I'm wanting to maybe move into freelance work but the market is flooded because of covid.  So many working from home and freelancing these days.\n",

      "Not sure what is going to happen to my industry. The demand for new products is astounding. For example we have been working on cargo holds for aircraft that replaces seats and maintains social distancing protocols.\n",

      "\n",
      "I've been looking but the market is flooded. I might just retire earlier than anticipated.  take on some freelance to supplement my income.  Upper management at my company is a bit...shall we say...uninterested in boat rockers.\n",

      "Boeing is a place I'd love to finish our my career with but I went through a 2 year hiring process with them a few years ago. Once I was offered the position I had to decline because the move to Washington was not feasible at the time because of family issues.  oh well.\n",

      "Thank you I appreciate that! Yes I am getting surgery like 2 days before christmas so this christmas should definitely be interesting to say the least haha.\n",
      "Yes exactly. I got my teeth fixed a couple days ago as well so that was good too! I am really leaning on my family for support but just felt like asking for some outside help which is why I am talking to you right now lol.\n",
      "I think I pretty much got everything I need from you- I just needed to vent I think. So we can stop talking now or whenever you have to leave\n",

      "I have no idea. Everything was working out well just a few weeks ago. I feel so lonely.\n",
      "No. I fear that I might get turned down. They are usually the ones that ask me out, and they haven't been doing that for weeks.\n",
      "You are saying that I have perhaps missinterpreted the whole situation?\n",
      "But wouldn't them call me if they were at least slightly interested?\n",
      "\n",
      "You know what, yeah, perhaps I just need to put a little more from my part this one time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think I should call my closest friend then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I feel really comfortable talking to her. I can be open about my concerns regarding other friends too.\n",

      "Not necessarily, i mean I have had access for awhile, but definitely when they were closed in my state for a period of time it sucked, this whole pandemic sucks lol\n",
      "I mean in school not doing great, and not super happy with my social life \n",
      "Its hard to stay motivated, I don't really enjoy it, i mean I am sure a lot of people dont' but its very hard to focus and I'm worried I am in school for the wrong reasons, covid stuff def doesnt help tho\n",
      "lol, not that easy, I dont know what profession I would train for... also I have been in college since late 2017 so I am at the final stretch and have already put a bunch of money in, I totally see where ur coming from though, however no trades really jump out to me and interest me. Maybe i can do research but again I am pretty far into college \n",
      "I agree! I've always worried about money, Im hoping that it becomes a bit of a nonissue, not to get political but the whole capitalism thing is a huge downer lol, Imagine being able to live life without worrying about money, very nice, but then again financial freedom isnt everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "forreal, our system is really weird, we place value on these random things and then force people to fight for pieces of paper their whole life, its an interesting problem\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "haha thats true, and dont sell yourself too short..., it is hard to get out of your own head and look at the other perspective, ill keep everything youve said in mind. anyways thanks for talking to me it was nice! have a great rest of your day!\n",

      "Yep, ill be getting back to my life and plans after. i have a bad heart condition so ive had to stay inside pretty much all year.  also another messed up thing my ex did to me, cheated on me and then came back into the house. she could have passed it to me.\n",

      "I think from now on I’m just going to focus on myself and my family, I’m not gonna out of my way to be nice to my coworkers, I’m just going to treat them as coworkers not as friends and just keep to myself \n",
      "I always feel like you have to be a friend to have friends, but I’m tired of being the only one putting effort in and getting taken advantage of \n",
      "I just feel like they just expect me to do things for them now and when I do it, it’s no appreciated because they just know I will do it.\n",
      "Yeah, I’m working on taking care of myself more than worrying about everyone else. I think the holidays make it even harder to set the boundaries \n",
      "Thank you! You have been very helpful. I think that will be my goal! Start learning to say no and don’t feel guilty about it. I think I am going to lower my expectations from other people and just start treating people as they treat me!\n",

      "Things have changed and my new supervisor has crushed my spirit by taking all the parts I love away.  She never liked me and now she gets to make me suffer.\n",
      "They really can.  I used to love my job and my team.  Now she has made everyone miserable because she just doesn't care about learning the job or the job at all.  My morale is low and worse because I can't help my peers who are struggling as well.  \n",
      "I have considered this many times.  Unfortunately, the next level manager doesn't respect or value my team in general.  She has made that clear.  She's also just awful and uncomfortable to talk to.  I've found her to just be mean sometimes.  It just feels so hopeless.  Just waiting for someone to notice.  Just hoping she fails. \n",
      "It's just really hard to show up everyday.  But I do.  Although the days are long and exhausting with no motivation to perform.  \n",
      "You are right.  She is a bully.  I have called her several names to myself, but not a bully yet.  My coworkers and I have discussed what options we may have.  My suggestion was that we work at our normal pace rather than scrambling to make up for her failures.  I wouldn't want to set her up, but I think her failing is the only way we will ever see a solution. \n",
      "I have applied for another job within my company.  There seems to be interest in me, so that's exciting.  It is a job I really want.  But then, of course, I feel bad about leaving my peers behind.  I really care about them.  \n",
      "Definitely. Everyone is struggling.  I am the one my team expects to help with some of the tasks she is not performing.  I'm happy to do it for my team, but there is no recognition.  But I think I have been giving them good advice about hanging in there, staying positive, etc...  I should probably listen to myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "You may be right.  My company has an anonymous reporting system.  I should learn a little more about how that works and see if that's an option.  I'm not sure things could get much worse at this point.  This could be my last ditch effort.  \n",
      "That's good advice and you saying it directly to me makes me think I should lean into it.  I can't just spin my wheels in misery much longer.  \n",
      "Most definitely. I feel more confident now about the anonymous reporting.  I'll gather some notes from my peers to ensure I have a viable complaint.  That's so helpful.  Thank you. \n",

      "Yeah. I have not missed a workout since COVID-19 started. That seems to keep me grounded.\n",
      "Yeah. In chicago, we have a lot of snow but also some good state trails. It's been helpful, especially when this first started. I live across the street from a forest preserve, which was a life saver.\n",

      "Not really. Most of my friends haven't dealt with that so they don't really understand what I am going through, or even what my son is going through. But you're right, I have to learn to let go and let him fix his own problems with no intereference from me.\n",

      "Yes, stress is terrible for chronic illness. I had goals to get back in check with myself, I've been worried about everyone else for so long and not really about me. The pandemic haulted a lot of that. I used to take rides and go out and enjoy nature or something simple by myself to rejuvinate but it's harder now being worried to be around people. I also have an 8 and 1 year old. While they are my world, it's taxing having littles depend on you 24/7 without a breather :)\n",

      "That is a very sensible way to look at things .. I do rationally realise that. Irrationally I just want him to come back to me and say that he made a mistake, though! \n",
      "That's exactly it! I keep thinking of all the good times we had together and the things that we did before her met Her. I just want those times to come around again even though I know they should not. \n",

      "It's mainly my husband. His spending habits are out of control. He thinks he need to reward himself for living. We can't survive if he keeps gifting himself.\n",
      "I've tried talking to him about it, but he claims that he needs to reward himself or he wouldn't do anything. Like, if he gets up and goes to work then he needs to eat out to reward himself.\n",
      "Exactly. And if I push further, he compares himself to other people: \"Well, at least I don't hit you.\" or \"At least I'm not an alcoholic\" Like I should thank him for existing.\n",
      "It's hard because we have children. When we were just dating, he was a different person. He didn't start to act this way until after our eldest was born.\n",
      "The problem all boils down to money. If I had enough for therapy I wouldn't be worried about his spending habits! lol. But, you're right, that's probably what we both need!\n",
      "Really? I'd definitely be interested in that. Do they have online therapy like that?\n",
      "Thanks for your help. You said you've been in similar relationships. Is this behavior common for men? \n",
      "Haha, true. I just wondered. I had previous relationships, but they were very short.  My dad was always the opposite: he was a penny-pincher. Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm just to stingy with the money, but then I remember that we have none, so Idk how to be more generous lol\n",

      "Trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. It is hard to escape the sadness.\n",
      "Yeah it is. Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. We tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts.\n",
      "Yeah it has been difficult and I know I will make it through. It is just difficult to get through break ups these days. Unless you disconnect you can't avoid the other person.\n",
      "Yeah I was thinking of maybe organizing a hunting/fishing/camping trip with my buddies over winter break. That could help get me out of the digital world and would help me spend quality time with my friends.\n",
      "Yeah I think that is probably what I will end up doing. It will probably help the mental health of the entire friend group, but especially me right now.\n",
      "Thank you for the help and the advice. I think I will follow through and make the trip happen. Any tips on eventually getting back out in the dating game in these strange times?\n",

      "Yes. I feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place.\n",

      "Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else's pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss (the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses\n",

      "yeah, it's tough.. I don't know if anyone is hiring. because of the timing like you mentioned. \n",
      "I've looked a little bit though\n",
      "\n",
      "haha I don't know... I'm sure someone has... heck the VP is getting a Bonus... so I'm sure he'd say he's having a good year\n",

      "I feel like as long as I am meeting the requirements and am passing, she should be proud of my accomplishments. \n",
      "She should be proud I am even going to college.\n",
      "Exactly. I feel like there is this society stereotype of needing straight A's otherwise you are a failure or something.\n",
      "A bit, but she uses the \"I pay for your education\" card.\n",
      "Which makes sense, but still, I know I am doing well so it's just a lot at times.\n",
      "I agree, but she does have money over my head, which sucks.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, I am very grateful for her financial support, but she uses it to manipulate me at times.\n",
      "Yes, I have received multiple scholarships, but nothing that will make a dent in the tuition. \n",
      "College is too expensive.\n",
      "That's what I keep telling myself, but I have this overarching fear that I will be in debt forever then.\n",

      "Besides the only reason I am taking that week off is because my kids are coming home. My son lives in Chicago and due to Covid I haven’t seen him all year and my daughter lives in Nashville and she used to come home often but also because of the pandemic , she has not been able to come as often as I would like\n",
      "No, I have not hopes of promotion, I have been 18 years with them and I have straight told them I just want to work through my retirement in the same position\n",

      "Yes, absolutely. I do not want to get covid and am worried about long term health effects. I have shared this with them but they still do not care. \n",

      "right, it's very uncomfortable and no matter how many times I tell them how risky they are being to not only themselves but others they do not care\n",

      "I have been struggling for motivation to do anything the past couple weeks.  This is a really hard time of year for me.  I lost my cousin in a car accident at the age of 14 in a car accident coming up on 20 years this year.  We were very close.  I was 17 at the time.  Her was an alcoholic and my parents raised her a majority of her life.  Then 3 years ago 5 days after her death anniversary I lost my boyfriend at the age of 32 in a car accident.  I dread the holidays.  \n",
      "You are exactly right.  The year my cousin got killed her mom was hungover so I went and picked up my cousin and her little brother to take them to our grandparents house for Christmas dinner.  She died 4 days later on Dec 29th.  And my boyfriend it was his first day back to work after the New Year.  He died on Jan 3rd. \n",
      "I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year.  This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them.  I have even bought one christmas present.\n",
      "\n",
      "My cousin doesn't live around here and we have never been real close.  He is alot younger than me.  We just never had the connection like his sister and I did.  And both my grandparents have passed away.  Grandpa has been gone for 12 years and Grandma has been gone for 4 now.\n",
      "My family has always been really good about talking about our loses. Things just will never be the same.  \n",
      "They say it gets easier. And I agree it does.  Things just have changed so much.  I miss how life was before I lost them.\n",
      "I love giving gifts.  And I always put lots of thought into the gifts I give.  My nieces and nephews can't wait every year to see what I got them.  \n",
      "This year I am tie dying hooded sweatshirts.  I make tshirts for a hobby.  And to tell you the truth thats the only gifts I have gotten so far.  My oldest daughter turned 18 this year and lives with her boyfriend so its just me and my 15 year old daughter.  She struggles with depression/anxiety as well.  Her dad has been in jail for some stupid actions since August.  She has had to deal with him being an addict pretty much her whole life.  I think we are both missing how the holidays were with her sister still living at home.  Too much change in our lives in such a little time frame.\n",
      "They will love them.  A couple years ago I put their names on fleece blankets when I worked at an embroidery shop.  They absolutly loved them!\n",
      "Just the normal traditions.  My oldest daughter will be here for Christmas morming.  Then we go to my parents.  \n",
      "Thank you for chatting with me tonight!  I hope you have a good rest of your night.\n",
      "I am ok.  Kinda having a rough day today.\n",
      "Sure.  It's coming up on 3 years next month that I lost my boyfriend in a car accident.  Its just really rough this time of year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extremely hard.  I remember that morning like it was yesterday.  He got killed within an hour after leaving the house on his way to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon.  And the worst thing is I was upset with him that morning.  He had an addiction to xanax.  I was not ok with it.  He had went and got some that morning and he would always give them to me so I could give them to him so he didn't take them all.  I was so upset that he went and got them.  He was packing up his truck with things to take to the new shop that day.  He was a tattoo artist and just started a new job.  I didn't even get out of bed to help him and he knew I was upset with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had decided that I was gonna wait to hear from him that day instead of texting or calling him.  I wanted him to realize how upset his addiction made me. Instead the phone call I got was that he had been killed.\n",
      "I haven't done any counseling.  I know I should and it would probably help me.  I don't know why I have not.  \n",
      "I don't feel guilt about it.  Now at least.  I was pretty hard on myself at first.  But I know that he knows why I was upset that morning.  It was something we dealt with a lot.  \n",
      "I went and talked to a therapist once right after and never went back.  And I don't know why.  He was amazing to talk too.  But I just never went back.\n",
      "I don't have any contact with his family.  I actually had to block them on all social media.  They are extremely religous.  Which there is nothing wrong with that.  But he didn't have the best relationship with any of them.  They couldn't accept him for who he was.  His biological father didn't have anything to do with him.  His mom was remarried and had two more kids and they didn't treat my boyfriend very good growing up.  He ended up living with his grandparents.  He finally had acceptance in my family.  He actually talked to my mom more than I did lol.\n",
      "His family has been pretty horrible to me and my girls.  And I know it's because they have guilt for the way things were with their relationship.  They didn't even invite me and my girls to the burial of his ashes.  \n",
      "It's very sad.  Not what I wanted at all.  But they were really horrible to me and my girls.  I know he would not be happy that they have treated us so poorly.\n",
      "His sisters went and cleaned out and took everything he had from the shop the day after the funeral.  Which really hurt.  The stuff he had there meant alot to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope I can too.  I just take everything day by day.  I start a new job this week and hopefully things will start looking up.  The last 3 years have been rough to say the least.\n",
      "We weren't married. And of course he didn't have a will.  He was only 32.  So according to his family I have no legal rights.\n",
      "Thank you for chatting with me.  \n",
      "Have a good night.\n",

      "he also searched for repeatedly this girl in one of his online classes who is very provocative to look at inappropriate pictures of her and I thought that was super weird I was so annoyed \n",
      "yeah and he has stopped he deleted insta but it still hurt my feelings and trust a lot \n",
      "\n",
      "and he lied to my face abt watching porn, I would not have been mad at all so there was no reason to lie about it but it made me sad and feel rly bad that he couldn't tell me \n",
      "its not cheating though bc he never did anything w anyone its just a violation of trust buuutt I don't know how big of a deal it is \n",
      "yeahhh, my friends have given me very mixed opinions abt what to do lol\n",
      "and it wasn't just like he lied once he did it constantly over the course of a year of dating  and hid everything and cleared his search and all that \n",
      "he gets very upset when I bring it up. that's mostly our issue its just hard for me to move past it bc I was cheated on by someone else in the past so it makes me hard for me to forgive him and not be jealous lol \n",
      "I mean I def let him know I hate it \n",
      "I feel like its maybe not something worth breaking up over but its just gross and makes me feel bad \n",
      "yeah truuue tysm. one of the girls he lusted over goes to college w us and she literally got kicked out of her sorority last year for sexually assaulting a guy who was passed out drunk and posted it on her snap story and he didn't care at all bc she posted cute pics of her booty lmao I was just so disgusted since I was r*ped last year at a frat house and like idk how u can still have any kind of attraction to people who do terrible things like that \n",

      "I'm doing my best, as is my husband, but with the holdays here we're struggling to explain our decision not to visit family because we want the children to be safe. Our family is a combination of Covid Hoaxers and antimaskers sadly.\n",
      "Thank you for agreeing with me. They are nine and four.\n",
      "Maybe. I'll have to give them a few days as my mother is very self centered and we just got into it last night, but I might give that a try\n",
      "That's good to hear, maybe I should do that.\n",
      "I'm not so sure. My husband's anxiety is worse than mine and I carry the mental load for the entire family. He's usually happier staying in the dark, otherwise it's too difficult to lift him up when he's depressed if I'm also depressed.\n",

      "Yes, it is affecting me.  In sum, I'm the only one left in his corner, but I feel like he's slipping away and becoming completely dysfunctional.  It's tough with privacy laws for me to even talk to his doctor to see what's going on.  I did send his doctor a long email, however, so hopefully he'll make whatever adjustments need to be made.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have.  He tells me that he's taking it regularly (or most of the time).  I challenged him on it and told him it can't be \"most of the time.\"  That's why I sent his doctor a long email, explaining things to him, to see if he can't intervene and try to straighten him out.\n",

      "kind of\n",
      "you think so?\n",
      "ok. ill consider that\n",

      "Hello, I have been better. How are you?\n",
      "Well.. I lost my job and so did my husband. Since then we have been fighting all the time. and he doesn't help anymore around the house \n",
      "Or with the kids\n",
      "I have and he turns it into something nasty. Like I am saying he is a lazy piece of garbage, or something like that . \n",
      "And it becomes a huge fight\n",
      "I wish he would. He sees me taking care of our 4 kids, cleaning, cooking taking care of the animals and he still does nothing\n",
      "The see everytime we fight. He usually gets loud and then I get loud. My oldest, 13, sees how he is acting. \n",
      "Today marks day 4 that he has been in the room playing games only coming out to get a drink\n",
      "I have had that talk with him, but I should do it again \n",
      "My toddlers don't understand\n",
      "I wish I could. I try to stay quite sometimes but he just keeps going on and on like he wants to fight. \n",
      "I think so to, but it is hard since we don't have jobs and no insurance\n",
      "Oh I have been trying. I have been applying everyday about 20 jobs a day. \n",
      "I was thinking of taking the kids to my dad for a weekend to get a break. Should I do that? without him.\n",
      "Okay I will try again. I agree. I am just tired that I am the one that keeps trying and he is doing nothing to fix this.\n",

      "... because she wants to give it to her 16 year old daughter. Who will also be getting a Lexus for her birthday.\n",
      "How is a diamond solitaire an appropriate gift for a 16 year old?\n",
      "He is so rabidly defensive of her, if I bring it up, it won't matter if he agrees with me or not - he'll take her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "And both our parents died last year - I can't lose him too.\n",
      "She's the only granddaughter - she'll get the ring eventually, if she wants it (probably won't). My SIL apparently thinks that was the only valuable thing about my mom - she didn't want any of the books, or art, or photos...\n",
      "Are you too busy to do this right now...?\n",
      "You're really not saying much.\n",
      "No, I should do that.  I see them on my phone and computer every day, but I should have a framed one up.  I just moved house, and I don't have all my stuff yet.\n",
      "I could do that... of course, if the frames aren't solid platinum they won't be good enough for my brother's wife...\n",
      "My parents both got dementia at the end, and I\"m sad that the kids won't really remember the real them. My mom was more than a diamond ring... And she would have been horrified at the idea of giving it to a 16-year-old who'd just throw it in a drawer with her other diamonds.\n",
      "I don't really see the kids. Not my choice. It hurts that my brother just goes along with it.\n",
      "I guess I'll sign off.  Thanks for talking, and for the ideas.\n",
      "Hello. How are you?\n",
      "I'm feeling so depressed!\n",
      "I can't seem to find a job...I've been trying so hard.\n",
      "I will run out of money, soon...\n",
      "Yes....and wearing masks is hard, too....I get claustrophobic a lot. I get through it though.\n",
      "I have a BA but that doesn't seem to help me find a job, much. Seems like all I see are jobs for construction type jobs.\n",
      "Yes, it's the main way I search. I've seen gas station and fast food jobs posted most lately.\n",
      "I hope so. To make matters worse I've messed up my UI paperwork it seems and now that is delayed.\n",
      "I\n",

      "\n",
      "I am trying to work in the mall now, as I think holidays are going to cause good business. Hope to get something.\n",
      "Maybe I will get a job where I can get a discount!\n",
      "I've tried that a few times, but it hasn't worked out that well...it seems like the managers are usually not there. I need a plan/time that I think I'll have more success. So far it's been hard.\n",
      "I'd like to find a job fair, but they are all cancelled from the pandemic.\n",
      "Or maybe they are there but they are hiding?\n",
      "I have a feeling most of the places I email just file it in the circular folder.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I have a desk in my bedroom.  My 3 kids are in college too, LOL.\n",
      "I wish there were some face to face or zoom like participation classes.  I dont like independant study.\n",
      "Not really.  I was wondering that too.  We have assignment where we \"post\" and \"respond\" to some topic or other.  Yeah I think that is a good idea.\n",
      "I like that idea, i think i will ask my kids how to set that up\n",

      "You are right, but I think I will talk to my husband first. \n",
      "\n",

      "I am doing pretty well. There's a beautiful sunset out my window.\n",
      "How are you?\n",
      "Absolutely. Since I got back from school I've had time to run around and climb trees and stuff and it makes me feel like a kid again.\n",
      "Are you able to see the details that I wrote at the top of the chat? I think they might only show up for me.\n",
      "Oh. It asked me to describe the problem I was having. I said that I have had trouble getting over losing a friend who I thought was my best friend for years but eventually I found out he was only acting and he didn't really care about me at all. It's been about a year since he told me that, and whenever I think about it it makes me sad. \n",
      "I don't know why it's so hard for me to get over it\n",
      "I think you're right. What do you think I can learn from it?\n",
      "I think that's wise, thanks. I was definitely putting too much effort into it and I hardly noticed that he wasn't reciprocating it. I have always had a problem with that.\n",
      "Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Hope you have a good evening. :)\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "I am battling with my childhood trauma that i feel is affecting my everyday life with my child and spouse. I don't know how to tell my spouse about my childhood in fear he doesn't want to be with someone with a upbringing such as mine.\n",
      "Yes, correct. I am not sure how to tell my spouse about my childhood trauma. He wants to know. He wants to help me. But I am not sure where to begin with explaining it to him.\n",
      "I am worried it will effect his views on me. And he has a very rough idea of things that have happened.. he tells me he wants to know everything so he can help me move forward.. but when i try to talk about it i ramble and end up not explaining anything. I have even tried writing it down.. and nothing seems to work.\n",
      "very much so.. whenever it gets brought up i free and begin to ramble and i think it makes him overwhelmed .. \n",

      "He had a very different childhood then myself. Almost complete opposite then myself. And I have tried... i cant seem to get my self to even put my past down on paper... \n",

      "When I have tried to i end up sending my self into a panic. \n",
      "No.. i do not know many people fro my area. As soon as i was able to leave where i grew up i packed up and left. We live in a extremely rural area where there is not many new faces. \n",
      "Maybe i will have to look int finding support group in my area...thank you very much!\n",

      "Yes, but my firm has already cut 10%. I feel like I would be next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently no. I am only a low level employee. This is what I am fearful of.\n",
      "Yes, but it will probably be minimal. I fear the economy will be in a downturn due to this lock down in my city. \n",
      "Ok, that is very helpful. Is there a lock down where you live?\n",
      "Oh, I am from Oregon. That is understandable. \n",

      "I never thought about it like that before.\n",

      "Wow!  Never thougt of it like that.  But still, i dont have a clue where those skills would be useful. All i know is the kitchen.\n",
      "You know what, i have never thought of that.  Those are actually good suggestions.  But im not sure if i am discipline enough to run that business on my own.  I cook, and thats about it.  The business part i've always had someone else doing that.  I dont know if i know how to even set that stuff up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dont know many people. i keep to myself. Dont know how i would find someone for the business side.\n",
      "\n",
      "your ideas sound great, but they may be out of my league.  I dont know if i am capable of doing my own business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow! you have great suggestions.  Thank you so much for your ideas.  I think i may give it a go.  You have made me feel better about my situation, and gave me some action items to tackle.  thank you for this conversation.\n",

      "I'm glad you haven't and so sorry to hear about them. We have been together for 13 years and have an 11 year old.  He has been dating someone for nearly two years and i had no clue.  I am so embarrassed and feel so stupid.  \n",
      "He is somewhat aware that something is going on but not quite sure what.  One of us will be moving out so it will need to be explained to him soon.  We have talked and he just denies everything.  He told me I'm crazy and they are just \"friends\n",
      "\n",
      "I would love to believe that but unfortunately I know that isn't true.  I'm just overwhelmed with so may questions that he is not answering.\n",
      "That is great advice! It's very hard to stand up for yourself sometimes especially when you are emotionally devastated. I visited him unannounced at work one day and they were having lunch together.  I had no idea who she was and she got up and ran off.  Upon further investigation, I checked phone records, receipts, any other thing I could find and all the evidence was there. two hour conversations, gifts from women's stores that weren't given to me. \n",
      "I haven't told anyone yet.  He just denies everything or has the perfect excuse for whatever I bring up.  I have confronted her as well via text. She states she doesn't even know who he is.  Really? So yeah.  I just want to grieve it and be over with it. I think just talking about it had helped a lot.  \n",
      "I workout every day so that has helped keep my mind somewhat focused after work.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I agree. I used to go to at least one concert every year. Now that's out of the question. It gets boring and a little depressing. Hopefully 2021 will be better. \n",
      "I will definitely. I just got to get up and get with it. I'm really in need of some exercise so I'll do that too. I used to paint and draw but I kind of fell off and stopped doing it. I'll get back into that too.\n",
      "I agree fully and I'm happy for you. I think I've been in some sort of depression for some time now. I stopped doing everything I loved. I used to love jogging but I stopped doing that too. I ended up gaining a lot of weight and now I don't like going anywhere or being seen at all. I'm usually 130 and I've shot up to 200.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "That's a good idea too. Maybe even someone who recently changed jobs can give me some interview tips! -Even if I get the interview I know I'm going to be anxious about that!\n",

      "I've joined \"mom groups\" and that does seem to help some. You're right I am losing my sense of self, that is a very good way to put it. \n",
      "It is very hard to talk to someone about these feelings, when we are all going through it. How have you been able to maintain your sense of self? Any tips? \n",
      "Thank you for your empathy and understanding. You are so right, self care is so important as a mom, especially right now. My husband doesn't understand that just by going to work he is able to escape for a little while. I will definitely try to practice more self care. Good luck to you and thank you for your advise!

      "I have used those tools. With the current environment in the world, I feel like dealines are a waste of time. I'm trying to go with the flow and just set daily goals.\n",
      "So you understand how the virtual learning has affected the day to day goals? I used to work during the day, complete my school work when the kids are in bed, but now everything seems so stressful.\n",
      "That's a great idea! Two of my kids are old enough to work independently most of the time, they are 11 and 8. However, I also have a 3 year old that requires constant attention. Unfortunately, her daycare is closed. Even more, I had to take on my nephew because his mother could not handle the virtual learning.\n",
      "I never even thought of support groups. It would help to connect with other moms, just to remind myself that I am not alone in this. Thank you so much. You also have a busy bee on your hands! \n",
      "Definitely have to go with the flow. They make life wondefully unpredictable. Thank you and those are fantastic ideas. I'll have to create a naptime, that would be the most helpful.\n",
      "Thank you so much for the wonderful advice. I will be looking into support groups, 2020 has definitely been a shake up for the whole world. I truly appreciate your support! Your kids are blessed to have you.\n",

      "Hi, how goes?\n",
      "Well, you see when I was dating my ex she and I had a threeway with the woman who was living in my mother-in-law apartment at the time.   Well the ex and I broke up not too long after, and eventually the mother-in-law woman and I got married.   My ex lives next door though, and her and my wife bump into each other all the time and sparks tend to fly.  It's kind of awkward in the neighborhood.\n",
      "Well, the ex has gotten in the wife's face once or twice, but that's simmered down some.   Part of the problem also is that the ex is simultaneously one of the smartest people I've ever met, and also a pretty serious alcoholic.   So she's brilliant, but kind of emotionally stunted at the same time.\n",
      "Oh I can't imagine ever moving.  We have a pretty terrific house.   Plus I bought most of the neighboring houses over the years, so now it's kind of a whole compound.   I don't know that there's any particular fix for this, it's just sort of something to live with I think.\n",
      "Oh a little bit.  She's only mildly weirded out by the whole thing.   It's a shame the ex has to be kind of problematic about everything.   I mean otherwise we could all still hang out and whatnot\n",
      "That's pretty good advice I'd say!   \n",
      "Yes, that's a possibility as well I suppose.\n",

      "yeah that's true. I will keep that in mind\n",
      "\n",
      "not that I have an active and huge problem, but that I don't think it's so bad, as mental illness is so stigmatized. You can go for therapy and talk things over even if you don't have that big of a problem. \n",

      "I'm not doing so well. I'm really lonely and kind of sad.\n",
      "Thank you. I broke up with my girlfriend. It was the right thing to do, but now I'm really lonely and sad.\n",
      "Yes, that's right. It's been really hard.\n",
      "Thank you. I was with her for about a year. It was good at first, of course.\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together? The loneliness gets so hard, especially when you just want to tell something to someone.\n",
      "Thank you. Honestly, I'm glad you're there to reach out to.\n",
      "Oh wow, that's a long time. And thanks. I appreciate your optimism! I am usually very upbeat and optimistic myself.\n",
      "Thank you. I really appreciate it. Hopefully I can help you somehow too. \n",
      "The shiba inu in my profile circle is making me smile. I used to have a shiba inu. :)\n",
      "That sounds really smart. I've been trying to do that. Of course with a pandemic going on it's more difficult.\n",
      "No no... my profile picture. Yours shows up as a squirrel. lol\n",
      "I usually hike a lot, but my hiking groups aren't going out right now.\n",
      "Maybe I should get a pet squirrel?\n",
      "Yes, I actually read and write quite a bit. Especially for work. That's not overly therapeutic, but it helps nonetheless.\n",
      "I have one dog who isn't much bigger than a squirrel. She has been an invaluable companion.\n",
      "I've tried to keep a journal but I never stick to it. I find that writing letters to friends serves me the same purpose, and it helps me to stay connected, too. Plus, people love getting real, hand-written mail.\n",
      "She is a miniature dachshund. Today she went to the bank with me, and all of the tellers came to the window to look into the car at her. lol  I like cats too. Animals are so healing.\n",
      "Yeah, and you're right. There's something therapeutic and cathartic about hand writing that typing does not replicate.\n",
      "Yes, it made me happy to see them fawning over her. And it made her happy because they gave her treats.\n",
      "Dealing with issues during Covid is so rough.\n",
      "I hope you're handling them okay. I'm generally well except for the whole breakup business. Still, I know I'm better off. It just sucks sometimes.\n",
      "I wish it was easier and okay to travel right now. A trip or a road trip would do me wonders.\n",
      "So is five years! I hope everything works out for the best for you, too.\n",
      "If there was no virus... maybe Scotland or Las Vegas to see some shows. Or up into Canada. (I'm in Pennsylvania.)\n",
      "My breakup was a few months ago too. I'm in the Poconos. :)\n",
      "I've been to Las Vegas about fifteen times. I love it there. I eat, go to shows, go to baseball games... it's awesome.\n",
      "Wow, that's maybe an hour from me. I grew up outside of Reading. I live right by Blue Mountain.\n",
      "Omg, yes. Travel! I've been to some really strange places. It's awesome. lol\n",
      "I haven't, but maybe I should! I teach, and I always have students who work there. lol\n",
      "Come to think of it, they might sabotage my tube. lol\n",
      "That's a really good idea though. Thanks. I always see groupons for tubing, too.\n",
      "Yes, they are open. I got an email yesterday or today that they're making snow now.\n",

      "I'm a bit confused what I should do. I've been laying low for now. I think I guy I dated might still be interested. But there is another one who is interested now. But he hasn't stepped up yet. Not sure if I should forget about both of them and stay single\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah. not sure if either one is worth it or not\n",
      "\n",
      "Something normal! Im fine with being single too. It comes with a lot less drama. \n",
      "\n",
      "companionship and nonconditional support. committment and that is hard to find out here these days. a lot of guys want the physical without the commitment. I'm getting too old for those games\n",

      "yes when it comes down to it. and i don't know if i will ever find it- especially these days. and i don't want to settle\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "do you think it's good if they find out about each other? sometimes guys try harder when they know there is competition. sometimes it makes them run the other way\n",
      "\n",
      "honestly im not sure. there is always that risk when doing that with guys. i better think long and hard before doing that!\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I feel so lonely\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I guess I could try to turn things around to a positive focus on what I do have.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I stop the shaking at night?  Do you have suggestions?\n",
      "Maybe I could think of things in my life like my new nephew to cheer me up!  He is so cute and makes me smile.\n",
      "I wish I were home and not in college though but I guess I am growing up and will learn from this to make me stronger.\n",
      "I need to remember that college is only temporary and I will have their support in the future again in person.  It's just so hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for the positive words.  I think I'll be sleeping better at night thinking of these words of encouragement.\n",
      "Thank you for helping me feel somewhat better.\n",
      "I feel like I'm good.  Thanks for your time.\n",
      "Hi there I was hoping you can help me.\n",
      "Well you see I am heartbroken and I can't seem to move on from a previous relationship, and its been over two years. Do you have any advice?\n",
      "Well I would say mentally because I frequently think about her and constantly have memories throughout the day. Also when i hear a certain song or see a restaurant it makes me think of her.\n",
      "They are a mix of both because at one point they were positive and now when I think about it, it brings me down in a negative way.\n",
      "What have you done in the past to help you move on from a break up?\n",
      "Yeah I agree that's what I have been doing too, and it's nice to know that you do the same.\n",
      "That's a good way to look at it.\n",
      "Well I have also not met anyone since and fear that I will not fall in love again.\n",
      "hmm interesting I have never thought about falling in love with myself..maybe I will give it a try. Thanks.\n",
      "I appreciate the feedback and support, you have helped me take the next step to move on with my life.\n",
      "Thank you and hope to talk to you again. Have a good night.\n",
      "Hi there, could I ask you for some help? \n",
      "Well not too great really. I am on furlough from my job because of the lockdown. \n",
      "It has been happening for most of 2020. I briefly returned to work but now I am furloughed again! What should I do? \n",
      "I get a certain amount of my salary but it is not enough to pay for all my expenses. Additionally I am feeling really bad about the fact that I can't leave home very often. \n",
      "I think it is a combination of both but - perhaps mostly the money worries. It would be ironic if we were to be made homeless at a time when we're not legally supposed to be outside for very long! \n",
      "We can just about scrape by on our mortgage but we were really struggling on other monthly expenses and are worried that some of them might not be paid by the bank. \n",
      "I have not really thought about reaching out to any of the people that we have to pay because I am afraid that they might not be sympathetic. Do you think it would be a good idea? \n",
      "I suppose that I probably do not have anything to lose - all that they can say is that they won't help us! \n",
      "This is very true. It does help to realise that I am not the only person in this position right now! \n",
      "I have been keeping in touch with friends and family on social media. It is a lifeline but I would still really prefer to be back out there at work! \n",
      "Do you think that this situation is going to be over anytime soon? It would really make a difference to me to think that it was. \n",
      "Well yes but the twenties were followed by the Great Depression - I am not sure how encouraging that is :D \n",
      "This is true - perhaps with the vaccine we can get back to normal sooner than later. \n",
      "I always wear a mask when I leave the house - it is the sensible thing to do! \n",
      "Quite! Do people really want to be infected? Does it hurt them so much to wear a mask and socially distance? I can get back to work sooner (and so can we all) if everyone adheres to recommendations. \n",
      "You have helped me to see that there might be an end in sight to this - thank you very much. \n",
      "Perhaps things will be better come January ... you never know :) \n",
      "On that note, thank you so much for cheering me up .. best wishes! \n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so frustrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I don't even know what is going to happen with finals now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don't worry. But I can't help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was doing so well in my classes too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very close to graduating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I don't do well with online learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope so too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you and thanks for letting me confide in you.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a weird and sad time these days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much. And I hope all is well by you too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy the holidays and be safe!\n",
      "hello\n",
      "I am just alone and have nobody to talk to and can't make friends because i have been through too much \n",
      "\n",
      "sure\n",
      "Because everyone I come across is into drugs and I do not do drugs\n",
      "recovery myself. I can not do it but I also have relapsed because of someone I met so I am just alone now because I am not going to do drugs again\n",
      "yes it does and I have no support because i moved to a new state so all my family is in tn and i am in ga now, no i do not i might think about that though i was thinking of maybe doing something online, but my finance is and i are doing a long distance thing for now and I do not want to accidentally go over a line if i happen to be paired with a male to talk to so i am just here waiting for him to get home \n",
      "no i dont think that would go over well. No i am agnostic. I do wish i had a good friend that knew me who I could talk to. he told me i could talk to one friend in tn and i call when i need something but it bothers him so i try not to do that.\n",
      "yeah it bothers him. and i don't want to bother him. \n",
      "yes he is.\n",
      "i talk to him about everything. he has been a good listener.\n",
      "yes it is. i thank you for your time. I hope you have a good day. thanks for the chat.\n",
      "thank you have a nice night!\n",
      "I'm sad because I found out my boyfriend broke up with me once he saw I came from a poor neighborhood.\n",
      "Yes, I kind of depressed over it though because I thought he loved me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I had a different home, but I can't change that now.  I'm trying to work so hard to do better, but it will take time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for the encouragement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he is missing out on a lot, but he isn't going to realize this now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think someone else will love me for who I am?\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I move forward?  Should I try to get him back and get him to realize he is not looking at my heart?\n",
      "Can I invest my time in anyone from outside my neighborhood?\n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds like good advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks so much.  That is reassuring.  I'm starting to feel better.\n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds like it will be helpful.\n",
      "I am feeling so much better.  Thanks!\n",
      "Thanks again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose a past experience so this will be hypothetical. But I'm looking for ideas for other resources for this course since my professor isn't helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "What other ways can I get help to perform better? Who should I talk to?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah I am, it's differential equations. Are you able to see the situation description I wrote that has more details?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah that could be useful. I'm not sure if my school offers that - the math department isn't very good. I'm an engineering major. I wonder if an engineering professor or student could help instead\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah that would be helpful. I think I need to hear things a different way. The professor is very confusing, but when I have gotten help from other students the concepts don't seem hard. I just don't do well with his teaching style I guess, it's not that I'm not smart enough to understand. Does that make sense?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, it can be very stressful when I don't understand though. I'm normally a very good student so it's easy to be hard on myself. But it's good to hear that this is a pretty common experience\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah that sounds really nice. One of the hardest things was that the professor would never go back and explain what he did, so a problem might be 20 minutes long and if you got confused 3-4 minutes in you were just lost for the rest of it\n",
      "\n",
      "That is actually one thing I'm pretty good at. I'm miserable when I'm tired, so I almost always get 7-8 hours a night.\n",
      "Thanks! It's reassuring to know other people felt the same way with this course. Sometimes I felt like I was dumb or lazy because I didn't understand, but it sounds like it's just challenging and those feelings are normal\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, that has always been hard for me, but I'll try to be deliberate about that\n",
      "\n",
      "I do, thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am, thank you. I feel good, and I think we have completed the requirements of the study, so I am good with wrapping up our chat now if you are\n",
      "\n",
      "You too!\n",
      "Hi there, are you free to talk? \n",
      "I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. \n",
      "He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. \n",
      "I presume you mean now and not not ;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. \n",
      "Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? \n",
      "I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it's worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened .. there is guilt that comes with that. \n",
      "Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day. \n",
      "It is just - very hard. I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him. \n",
      "I know that he did :). I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. He did not get to enjoy his retirement! \n",
      "Yes. I think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun. \n",
      "I can't really afford to have therapy at the moment. Also I know that my dad was just have considered it to be a waste of money - he was very careful with money. \n",
      "That is a really sensible suggestion and it cheers me up to think of it. You have been a really great help to me. \n",
      "You really have been. I hope you have a great rest of day! \n",
      "I've lost my job due to COVID and I'm really worried.\n",
      "I want to look for a new job, but I'm worried about being out with COVID.\n",
      "I don't know where to begin.\n",
      "Not particularly but I am open to it.\n",
      "Where do I begin to look for new jobs?\n",
      "Those sound like great ideas some of which I hadn't thought about before.\n",
      "Yes, that's true.  Maybe that will help me pass the time too when it is so hard to be at home.  I would be working toward a long term goal.\n",
      "I think that would be a good idea.  \n",
      "Thank you for the help.  I feel a lot more comfortable thinking about the future.\n",
      "I think that I'm okay now and can move forward in a positive direction.  Thank you.\n",
      "I have an issue in that coronavirus and all the news is giving me a lot of anxiety. I really don't want to leave the house and start to panic at the thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. I watch the news and it's everywhere these days. There seems no end to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What of his vaccine doesn't work. Even the thought of leaving the house still feels me with worry and I start to feel panicked. It's like my mental Outlook has completely changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact I have been on sick leave from work since it started. My partner is understanding to a point but yes, I'll need to provide once this is all over. I'm starting to think I'll be scared of leaving the house, even when Covid gets managed and we gather back to 'normal'\n",
      "\n",
      "it's great that you can relate. how are you managing those frustrations?\n",
      "\n",
      "so you mean maybe leave the house when it's really quiet to begin with? then slowly build on that over time. isn't this called exposure therapy. I think I have read about this\n",
      "I suppose it makes no sense to worry about things you can't control. I think from my perspective that's exactly the problem, not having control. I don't know why this has affected me so much?\n",
      "yes I know about all the guidance and it would help to follow this. I see my friends dealing with it just fine. I wonder what is making it so hard for me? perhaps I'm overthinking it and just worrying about it excessively.\n",
      "yeah I think I really need to give that go. if that doesn't work maybe there are some support groups out there?\n",
      "So true! also I think I need to stop watching the news and obsessing about this\n",
      "the one thing I do have is time. Thanks for talking through this with me.\n",
      "you too take care.\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "Ok Kinda, my back is just hurting so bad today.\n",
      "yes, it is like a real Charlie Horse that just won't stop.\n",
      "It has been going on for over ten years now. I can't hardly walk and I can't hardly sit still.\n",
      "Yes, I have had back surgery, tried Yoga, and chiropractors, and physical therapy. Nothing has worked.\n",
      "It is just hard, waking up in the middle of the night with pain and not being able to go back to sleep. It drives me nuts some days and I just stay away from everyone. \n",
      "I try to hide the pain from my family because the man of the house is suppose to be strong and provide for his family. I have a very loving wife and a set of twin boys that just turned 13. I am blessed in so many ways but I still seem to have to suffer to enjoy it.\n",
      "I feel your pain, I have came a long way in managing the pain mentally. I try to block it out and keep my mind busy to not think about it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. \n",
      "I have sever spinal stenosis and a deteriorating bone disease. The surgeon said it was worse than he thought and he done all he could. He was afraid to go any deeper because I might not walk again if he did.\n",
      "Thanks for the words of encouragement. It makes me feel better knowing that people in the real world still care about others and how they feel. \n",
      "Sounds great, I will check into it with my doctor. Have a nice day. \n",
      "You too.\n",
      "Hi there, I am desperate to get some help for my ongoing depression, is there anything that you can do? \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it's not really any worse tonight than it has been for years. I just don't know how to get out of it and I suspect that I might never be able to. \n",
      "I have been prescribed some medication by my GP but I cannot really afford professional counselling. \n",
      "I am sorry for the delay, I had a personal emergency. What sort of things are you talking about? \n",
      "No, I am British. There are limited resources available here but not many and there's a waiting list. \n",
      "The trouble is also that I have tried a variety of medications and none has really been all that helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I am on some waiting lists but I do not know how long it might take to get to the top of them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why do you say that medication is not the best idea? I am aware that it is not a panacea but it can help to take the edge off, as it were. \n",
      "I think that there are some conditions where medication is necessary but I do take your point that there are other things that we can do to alleviate symptom. Maybe it is best to do these things in tandem? \n",
      "I also went through a lot of different combinations before ending on on Prozac. I think that different things work for different people. I do not find it very easy to talk to people. \n",
      "No, I am rather way of 'natural' or homeopathic medicine. Are there any kinds that you could recommend? \n",
      "I do do a lot of that but I would feel too shy to show anyone my journal. Your help has been invaluable though and I do feel more receptive to other forms of treatment now. \n",
      "I often do go over things that I've rewritten but there can be long periods where I just feel that I have nothing to say. Thank you so much for your help though, I do feel a lot better! I hope to see you again soon. \n",
      "Hello, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I'm really upset with my friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, they aren't taking COVID seriously.\n",
      "Yes but they get angry with me. I don't know how to get through to them,\n",
      "\n",
      "I really don't know I just haven't been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a weird dynamic.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's exactly right.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to think so but I wish they would too. It's hard to know what is right.\n",
      "\n",

      "Thank you, I am really glad that you understand. I don't feel that I will ever be able to trust any man again! \n",
      "I can't really afford professional help. And I don't want to be a burden on my friends. I worry that I am already annoying them. \n",
      "I do have a friend who has been through the same though ironically it is a male friend whose wife cheated on him! \n",
      "Yes. It is just such a deep betrayal. I think I could have forgiven him if it had just been a one time mistake but he had been seeing her for ages. \n",
      "It is nice to have things to distract myself from the things that are making me feel terrible. Do you have any other suggestions for distractions? \n",
      "I just keep thinking that every evening when he was returning home with me and with every nice thing he said he was being false. \n",
      "Hmm that sounds .. interesting :D. Is that a metaphor? \n",
      "I know, right!! Do you think it would be helpful for me to try and talk to this woman and see how she feels? I dunno if she even realises that he was in a committed relationship \n",
      "Anything that will help me with my anxiety is worth trying at the moment. \n",
      "It would be less of a betrayal, I think, if she did not know about me. I would never do that to another woman! \n",
      "I suppose that's a good point too. I think maybe I do just need to make a total break and not look back. \n",
      "I do appreciate you talking, you have helped me to see things a great deal more clearly than I previously did.\n",
      "Thank you and the same to you! Have a nice rest of day. \n",
      "Hello\n",
      "Well. Not so good i just broke up with my girlfriend and she is packing her stuff to leave\n",
      "How are you doing?\n",
      "Well technically it was a mutual agreement but i feel like I dont want this to happen\n",
      "So what are you up to?\n",
      "Hello? Are you there?\n",
      "Well. Basically all started for jealousy and she saw a couple of text messages of my best friend and she misunderstood the conversation and since then its not the same. \n",
      "She doesnt trust me \n",
      "I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work\n",
      "So it got to the point that nothing was the same\n",
      "So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out\n",
      "We were together for two years\n",
      "Im trying my best to go through this\n",
      "I hope so. Thanks for all those words\n",
      "It really helps\n",
      "Well thank so much. You really help me a lot with every single word\n",
      "Well i have to go. Ill talk to you later\n",
      "Hello there, would you be able to give me some advice? \n",
      "The first lockdown was bad enough but the second has really thrown me into despair. I simply cannot cope without being able to see friends and family for much longer. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have run out of coping mechanisms!\n",
      "\n",
      "I use facebook quite a lot and it helps but it cannot compensate for face to face contact. I really need to be able to see people. \n",
      "Well, part of the problem with that is that I am not sure what the rules are any more! We have been told so many different things that I am out of the loop. \n",
      "I always do wear a mask.. I think we legally have to :). I really miss little things like going out for coffee or to the gym though. It makes me feel like will never be the same again. \n",
      "I have a little bit but I don't want to burden them. The other aspect is that it is making me anxious about many others things too. I keep having morbid thoughts about what will happen if the pandemic never ends. \n",
      "That's why I'm here ;). You are being very helpful, thank you! It's just nice to be able to tell people what I am worried about and not have them think that I am just being silly. \n",
      "\n",
      "That does sound like really good advice. The other thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I have been having financial pressures because I am on furlough. I am worried that if this lasts much longer I will end up deep in debt. \n",
      "\n",
      "I felt that you were very helpful. It is nice to just know that someone is listening. I do not think that there is much in the way of local resources at the moment - everyone is very stretched. \n",
      "I do feel better for having been able to talk to you about this - thank you very much! \n",
      "I think I will be able to carry on for a bit now. Thanks again and best wishes! \n",
      "\n",
      "Just can not seem to get out of this funk\n",
      "Nothing seems to be fun and I work from home\n",
      "I think this whole Covid thing has been depressing! I get my work done but it is a chore.\n",
      "I live with my spouse, and I did work at home before. Pioneer story funny! It is hard not being able to enjoy going out. \n",
      "Just want it to be over and then the election too!\n",
      "There has been so much emotional things in the world going on right now\n",
      "BLM, election Covid...\n",
      "I would say when i take a walk at the park it does help\n",
      "Also working out\n",
      "So exercise and sunshine brings my mood up a bit\n",
      "good advice\n",
      "I will try\n",
      "Yes, things that I cannot change and the things I can change, including a more positive attitude\n",
      "Yes, I need coffee first! Thank you for your advice!\n",
      "Happy Thanksgiving:)\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "\n",
      "I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened out of interest when you had the conversation?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.\n",
      "   \n",
      "I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way!\n",
      "\n",
      "very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her?\n",
      "\n",
      "not at all. I appreciate your candour.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this is tied up with who and I know I'm valuing the wrong things. You are right actually. I think some of this comes from my low \n",
      "self-esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe I need to deal with it directly.\n",
      "That seems like well considered and thoughtful advice thanks for that. What is clear is that we need to have a conversation. Thanks for helping me reach this conclusion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "\n",
      "I am OK but I have a bot of a work issue that I'd like some support with if possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have done the same job for 7 years but it is now full and boring. It pays OK but it is all I know. I'm scared that I will get resentful in this job if I stay where I am but I haven't got a clue what to do for the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's exactly it yes. The question is I don't have any official qualifications, just experience and I'd like a change of career but this scared me to death! \n",
      " \n",
      "Potentially yes but the position above me is not really like for me and I don't like the reporting line. I think I fancy a change but not quite sure how to tackle it. I need the income so can't just leave but also need to do something about it. do you understand the predicament?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah meet too it's just finding a way where I can maybe stay where I am whilst exploring other opportunities to see what I'd like to do. It's a tough one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sue that's actually a good idea. No harm I suppose and my current employer would be none the wiser.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know, it is a big world out there and I have been doing the same thing for so long. It is exciting but also quite unnerving. Is this normal?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have experience and I am pretty hard-working. I have also made quite a few connections over the past 7 years.\n",
      "Yeah reaching out to my network is probably a good idea - as long as they keep the fact that I am looking for something else quiet. I'd state on Linked in that I'm looking for work but then everyone would know :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually you might be right there. I should be able to open up about this and they should be supporting my development. Great suggestion. I think I'm overthinking things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes true thanks for your understanding\n",
      "\n",
      "You have indeed, thanks for this conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will do, thanks again!\n",
      "Hello there. I'm suffering with increased depression and I'm not quite clear why.\n",
      "\n",
      "No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since lockdown  haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available?\n",
      " \n",
      "What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues?\n",
      " \n",
      "That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi my company laid off 10% of the workforce yesterdsy and I'm worried \n",
      "I\n",
      "I'm next\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I'm really nervous about what's happening. Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now\n",
      "\n",
      "No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago. I'm the only breadwinner right now\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah my wife filed and we just started getting it but it's nowhere what she was making of course. But yeah we can at least pay the electric bill and stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm an owner. What kind of programs?\n",
      "oh ok that's a good point. I will definitely go look for it after this discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah how can I make more money on the side?\n",
      "\n",
      "it's sort of why I'm here but it is so hard finding anything good\n",
      "\n",
      "oh cool, that's good to know. Well, I appreciate all your help. I hope you and your family stay safe during the holidays!\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't tried Instacart but I did sign up for Uber but it's been hard to get gigs. It's really cutthroat out there\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi I am not sure what to say here. I am not doing very well at all. I am feel sad and hopeless all the time, nothing is any fun, nothing makes me feel that I am doing anything good for anyone.\n",
      "I don't have any money to pay someone, my boyfriend tells me to quit having a pity party no one is coming to it and to just get over it. His comments and suggestions have not been helpful. My friends have tried to cheer me up but I can tell they are getting frustrated with me and I try to avoid them now.\n",
      "I don't mean to put obstacles in the way of your help but I live 25 miles from town and there is no public transportation here and I don't have a car. You have felt like this before? How long did it last? What did you do to get better?\n",
      "I think I feel this way because I feel so stuck. I make a little money working remotely but not enough to make any     big changes and the things I do don't ever last like the house is only clean for moments. \n",
      "You are right, one of my friends who has asthma started getting her meds through an online doctor and I am sure therapists are on line also, she said her doctor is even reasonable and less than her normal office visit that is something I can look into.\n",
      "What would be an example of a smaller goal? Enjoy your son my kids are grown and gone and it happens faster than you think.\n",
      "I don't really have big goals because they all seem too impossible to be realistic.\n",
      "Your small goals seem big to me. I can barely drag myself to the kitchen must let get motivated enough to clean it.\n",
      "That would be a simple goal, I could try for that, I think maybe I should make my first goal to find an online therapist with a sliding fee scale. Do you know if there are any kind of directories for online therapists?\n",
      "How long did it take for you to start to feel better after you started to get  help?\n",
      "Thank you things don't seem quite as hopeless now and I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. You have a nice day and I am going to go do that search now.\n",
      "Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months.\n",
      "Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. \n",
      "Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world.\n",
      "Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful.\n",
      "How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them.\n",
      "I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays.\n",
      "No but I did love that show as a kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dad and my GF's dad both have their own opinons on things\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. I also don't feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "No but near him and take care of him.\n",
      "That is good and bad. I think it is good to talk about though I do feel a little better thank you.\n",
      "Ok thank you very much. I think this is a good stopping point, so thank you for your help\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed. it helps to have people to talk to right?\n",
      "\n",

      "Oh no that's terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is, I am right now the only breadwinner in the family. My wife was laid off three months ago\n",

      "\n",
      "What am I supposed to do? Just breathe in and out a lot?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh I didn't know that. No, I haven't tried that. Does it really work?\n",
      "\n",
      "ok I can try it I guess\n",

      "thanks for that tip\n",

      "I'd hate to be seen as a complainer.\n",
      "And the person above him, is the person who hired him.\n",
      "Thats true. I'm not happy at work, but I do love my job. I enjoyed it a lot before him arrived. But now I'm constantly thinking about finding a new job, or worrying about him pushing me out. Maybe thats what he wants, so he can bring in his own people?\n",
      "Thats good advice. I do need to do more outside of work to relieve the stress.\n",
      "I'll try to do that. Do you think I can speak to him about his tone and maybe explain that communication is much more relaxed?\n",
      "I think its worth a try, but I don't want him to think I'm being argumentative. Any suggestions on how to have that conversation?\n",
      "Making it his idea. That's a good tactic. I could try that.\n",
      "And maybe giving him time to understand the workplace as it new to him too.\n",

      "No online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training.\n",
      "I'm so sorry. I feel a little better talking about this. My family tries to help other family members but we can only do so much. That's when I got frustrated (helping them with unemployment)\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, she is very close friends with my nephew's mother as well. She is the kind of person who will go into deep debt and overdraw her bank account to buy someone a gift, I am not. I could not afford the gift, I am disabled and on a very minimal income.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did. I took a few days to cool off and then told her that her comments hurt me. I know that she's aware of my financial situation as well as the fact that I am disabled. Her response was that she said nothing wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, she really never has. Typically, she feels like other people walk all over her and take advantage of her, but that's never been me and its never been our relationship.\n",

      "I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think knowing that I don't have to drive to campus is what makes me feel like I can sleep in. It feels much easier to just wake up and go onto my computer than having to get ready in the morning and drive to campus. I think I mostly miss that routine. Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights. \n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly. It was much easier for me when I had a routine schedule, versus knowing that I can just wake up, roll out of bed, and go to class, but I think that your suggestions are really going to help me finish my semester on a better foot\n",

      "Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination.\n",
      "I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable.\n",
      "I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don't want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don't  ever want to feel like this again.\n",

I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there. I thought he was just being nice. Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere.\n",
      "Thank you for checking on that for me, I hope it is quicker I would hate to feel this way that long. I think I will go see him he is home right now. You have made me feel hopeful and that there will be an end to these feelings and maybe things will go as well for me as they did you. Thank you again.\n",

      "Yes, I think I going to get some bread pudding and drop it off over there too.  I can take enough precautions to make sure it is safe for them.\n",
      "Yeah I guess we can do a toast and stuff on zoom.  That might be a little better.\n",
      "Are you kind of in the same boat?  It helps a little bit talking with somebody that is.\n",
      "I see, well my family isn't that big but we do try to get together every thanksgiving to have a good meal and hopefully watch the Cowboys win.  This will be the first time in a long while that I can even think of we aren't doing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a fair point.  Hopefully this will only be a one year disturbance with these vaccines on their way.  They should both have theirs well before then and hopefully me too.\n",

      "you are right this is very stressful. I've gotten used to the steady income and now we lie on it. the problem is I do work quite late hours so have limited time to study. any suggestions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I can ask for a different shift pattern yes, or reduce my hours. I may need to take a look at my finances and do a bit of recalculating. Have you ever had a situation like this?\n",
      "I wonder if there are courses and qualifications that you can get just by studying maybe an hour a day or an hour every other day?\n",

      "About three months ago. I have started to miss her badly. I saw her with another guy when I was out at the supermarket at the weekend. She lives near me so I wasn't surprised but I don't know who this guy is. \n",

      "\n",
      "I must admit it was only when I saw her with someone else that I started to really miss her. do you think I'm just feeling jealous because we were so close and now I've seen her with someone else?\n",

      "Well that's good to know. I'm not normally the jealous type but I suppose we did have good times and I want her to be happy I suppose. I do think I've made a mistake though now I've thought about it!\n",

      "do you think I should try and get in touch with her and tell her how I feel?\n",

      "Yes, I suppose you are right. My aunt is the youngest sister of my mom. We used to see each other at family gatherings. Maybe she won't mind me calling. \n",
      "I'm going to follow your suggestion and get myself out of this slump I'm in. I know I'm not the only person who goes through this, but it feels this way sometimes.\n",
      "You have a good point there. I used to think if I had my family then I didn't need anybody else. But we all need somebody to talk to.\n",

      "did you find a list online or make it yourself?\n",
      "what should i do when i finish cleaning?\n",
      "good idea, i am just finding it hard to get away from the constant bad covid news. i feel like i'm always on high alert. it's stressing me out\n",

      "I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town . like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual  city is 45 miles away\n",

      "\n",
      "yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum . I do appreciate the advice and ideas\n",
      "And appreciate that especially during the current situation. \n",
      "You as well.\n",
      "Oh I did want to ask. do you have any experience in either Alaska or Arizona? I know vastly differnt places but when I move I had been considering those. among others. Alska seems so risky but potentially amazing but it is rather far away from \"main america\"\n",

      "yeah. also 1,000 bucks a year on your taxes just for living there but concerned internet would be bad and if you have power outage in the winter in Alaska...not gonna be a good time so have anxiety sometimes . I can search more on my own\n",

I don't know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons\n",

      "Maybe not so much left out but moreso left behind. I really feel like everyone else is where they're supposed to be in life and I'm just floundering here without a clue what to do next. I'm just so used to being a mom that now that my son is getting mroe independent, I really feel like when I try to look at myself, I don't see a path to things working out\n",
      "\n",
      "I really have no idea. I've been depressed for a really long time. I don't find joy in the things I used to so I don't even know what I like to do.\n",

      "No. I've isolated myself pretty good. Staying inside because of the virus has definitely helped to ease my anxiety but it makes life pretty lonely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really appreciate you saying that. I used to be in a bunch of online support groups for single parents but life kind of got in the way and I didn't have a lot of time to focus on myself. I always had to be there for my son.\n",

      "I think things will improve, but not for a year or more.  \n",
      "A year is a long time when y\n",
      "A year is a long time when you are 76 years old.  I just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can't enjoy it any longer.\n",
      "Thank you so much for your support.  It is tough and there is nothing to do.\n",
      "Yes, I do, but I can't talk to my son in Florida because he lost his job and havng  tough time.  I don't feel like I should enjoy my life when he is suffering.  We may need to help him financially.  I use to volunteer at a nursing home, but I am afraid to now with the virus\n",
      " I am trying to do what I can for my son and also to help so I don't get too down and depressed.\n",
      "Thank you - that makes me feel some better.  You are right and I learned more than ever that some things I con't control.   Yes, we are all struggling and trying to get this this pandemic.  I am sorry that we are all going through this and pray it will get over soon.\n",
      "Yes, we will get through this - it helps so much to have others support.  I do thank you very much for talking with me today.  Have a great day!\n",
      "Hello, I am here to talk about my daily stresses\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi pleased to meet you and hope you're doing well\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah I am okay. Just daily stresses such as disrupted life routines from the pandemic and growing anxiety as my city is facing the beginning of the second wave.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah you bet\n",
      "\n",
      "for example, I only go out once or twice a week for my job, and once every two weeks for groceries. And that's it. But even then, when I have to be in close quarters with coworkers and even to go out for groceries, that scares me.\n",
      "\n",
      "like it was only this tuesday when my city finally acknowledge there's community spread and second wave, when it has been happening slowly for the last two weeks!\n",
      "\n",
      "it's irresponsible and they share information slowly to the public and don't disclose enough information. And they are still not shutting down gyms or restaurants, when they are the main sources right now in my city.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah I have been doing all that, with the washing of the hands and so forth. The situation at my job is unavoidable but I am still as careful as I try to cope. \n",
      "\n",
      "well, it's only today they brought the limit to social gatherings from 10 to 5. \n",
      "\n",
      "too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down \n",
      "selective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc. \n",
      "yeah there's a local line but it's a pretty big city and it wouldn't really matter what I say \n",
      "\n",
      "but anyhow, I have been conferring with my friend pretty much daily on the phone and that does help with social support. \n",
      "\n",
      "But thanks for that advice, it's a good idea\n",
      "\n",
      "yes definitely, since I live alone and pretty much self isolated since March of this year. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have gotten used to it and more comfortable. Before I was more nervous, lonely, and claustrophobic. It is better now but my fear is coming back due to the rising cases. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah thanks for listening. And this does impact my daily routines, from my workout patterns, sleep patterns, and diet. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah somewhat \n",
      "\n",
      "but not productive energy. I tend to be lethargic, immobile at my computer for long times, surfing the net aimlessly when I should be studying, and just distracted. \n",
      "\n",
      "and I sleep real late and wake up real late. It's all backwards and unhealthy and I am disappointed in myself. I also work out less because I can work out at home but I have done that less and less as somehow I don't feel motivated. \n",
      "\n",
      "okay yeah good idea. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can look for more videos too on such resources\n",
      "\n",
      "like I don't play any musical instruments but that would be great for a distraction like that or to pass time or to improve on a craft or project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just pretty much my studies with two online courses and not even reading anything outside of school. And even then, my school work ethics suck and I am kind of disappointed at my lapses that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "ok yeah great ideas\n",
      "\n",
      "I have started to put away my phone\n",
      "\n",
      "as I realize that I use it a lot too \n",
      "\n",
      "So I put it at the opposite end of my room for example\n",
      "\n",
      "started doing that lately and so the screen time has reduced somewhat\n",
      "\n",
      "so just trying to channel my productive energy into finishing school deadlines\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah for sure, especially following up news from around the world and in the states\n",
      "\n",
      "just stressful loads of news just catching up to daily events\n",
      "\n",
      "and as for daily schedule, yes I have kind of more control on that too as I try to write down what I should do now and set an alarm to start doing this at this time etc, especially in juggling my school work. \n",
      "\n",
      "but yeah your ideas are great and match my thinking exactly\n",
      "\n",
      "I see. okay I will keep doing that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will search that book too, interesting title \n",
      "\n",
      "okay then. I am good to go on that note. Thanks for reaching out and listening. It's great that you understand and am providing great advice. \n",
      "\n",
      "ok\n",
      "\n",
      "kind of a reminder on what stresses me and to avoid that etc\n",
      "\n",
      "that's great\n",
      "\n",
      "like a debriefing \n",
      "\n",
      "you've given a lot of great suggestions actually. Thanks a lot for that\n",
      "\n",
      "you've been quite helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "for sure. I believe that also\n",
      "\n",
      "avoiding stressors and cope \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah I am okay. They are coming to an end at end of this month and next so dialing down so I am at a crunch period. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you again and I hope you well also. And keep staying well and safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, I;m not too good. Just trying to get over a really bad breakup, still haven't wrapped my head around it to be honest\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, apparently the covid situation was getting to him and after he lost his job, he decided he wanted to find himself and try the single life after ten years together\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, thankfully, I was basically supporting us both. It was just the shock of it all. I came home from work and he was packing his things, no discussion, nothing just it's over and I've literally been crying all day. I don;t even think I miss him, I'm just mad about how he went about it\n",
      "\n",
      "No contact, I sort of lost my temper when he tried to talk things over because I think he was going to use this as a threat but I was so disgusted after being tired from work that I just threw my phone and now my way of contacting him is gone \n",
      "\n",
      "I sort of don't think I want him back. Not when he thinks our relationship is some sort of pawn for him to hold over my head. It sucks because my parents didn't even like him, I stuck my neck out for him and now this happens\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm more scared of being alone because we were together for so long, you know? Like I haven't ever lived on my own. It sounds dumb but I think I'm going to miss the company more than my relationship\n",
      "\n",
      "Or I could get a cat, to be honest being a cat lady might be less stressful\n",
      "\n",
      "A cat would definitely be cheaper\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for listening to me gripe about this, I was just shocked, you know? Like ten years gone down the drain but I guess that's life\n",
      "\n",
      "A kitten definitely sounds like a good idea\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you and you too\n",

      "Hello\n",

      "\n",
      "If I want to do something , I think it's negative part only\n",
      "Thanks for the hint. I tried it many-times. But I can't.\n",
      "Do you have any other idea to get out from this negative point of view mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "For example If I want to answer for question front of other people , I am not able to answer even I know the answer. \n",

      "Thank you. I try to change myself from now. No one can play my role better than me. Thank you for your cooperation. \n",
      "I am feeling very depressed lately.\n",
      "Like a constant pressure that i don't know exactly what it is\n",
      "I think the days getting shorter makes it worse.\n",
      "Do you have any tips on how to overcome it?\n",
      "Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up\n",
      "I like to stay up, but when it's time to get up i dread it\n",
      "Bad cycle \n",
      "Time is the fire in which we burn.\n",
      "Lol...yes it is\n",
      "The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality\n",
      "And drives the civil unrest which makes me feel anxious and insecure\n",
      "Yes i find that a strangly comforting thought \n",
      "They have the luxury of instinct without having to \"think\" at all\n",
      "They just be fleas.\n",
      "Fleas gonna flea.\n",
      "I worry too that the U.S. government has no idea what it's doing\n",
      "And the people at large are all losing their mental health \n",
      "I guess it's like you said before, we can only change ourselves\n",
      "And focus on our own development\n",
      "True\n",
      "Well thanks for your support and kind words, ending chat now\n",
      "I'm not so well.\n",
      "I'm really anxious over a breakup.\n",
      "I'm not sure where to go or what to do?\n",
      "I don't know how to be alone.\n",
      "Where can I go for support?\n",
      "That sounds like something I could try.\n",
      "My sister has been through a similar situation and perhaps could help.\n",
      "That is a good idea.\n",
      "That is so true.  Thanks so much.  I'm going to get some help and am feeling better about things.\n",
      "Have a great night.  Thanks again.  \n",
      "I feel so much calmer now after chatting with you.\n",
      "Hi there, I guess I just want to talk about some academic pressure\n",
      "\n",
      "I am just trying to pull an all-nighter and try to get through some lengthy reading of my textbook. I have a final coming up after next week. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah just trying to speed through the readings as I still have more than a few units to read through \n",
      "\n",
      "and meanwhile, have one assignment from this course also at the end of this month, \n",
      "and another course's assignment, and that course's exam is coming up next month. \n",
      "yeah just trying to load myself up with coffee. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am used to the idea of staying up because I have been doing that since the pandemic early on this year, but I seem to be distracted and procrastinating, especially in the early hours of the morning, and just go on the computer and waste time, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's kind of hard to sit myself down I guess\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah this is my third go through the entire course, the third round of studying. So that the knowledge would be fresh in my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "just the entire next week is all I have left to get through like 6 units of readings\n",
      "\n",
      "plus finish up the assignment and I have a part-time job, and plus doing some catching with the other course which is all due next month after this course.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah it sure has. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can go on and on about that too \n",
      "\n",
      "And another thing is by the time I get wise up to not procrastinate, like around 3 or 4 am, I become tired and sleepy, and my brain kicks in and immediately doesn't cooperate. So just a pattern of that going on lately. \n",
      "\n",
      "thanks just gonna do my very best and be mature and catch up because my marks have been good but have been procrastinating, lazy, and slow with everything since the pandemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah it's stupid. Once I am done with these two courses, I can finally stop sleeping so late. Because regardless of the courses, I have been sleeping at around the same time, which is late almost every night, since the pandemic started. \n",
      "\n",
      "so it will be a good time for me to take a breather and reset my bad bad habits and circadian rhythm after these two courses. \n",
      "\n",
      "and get back to some normalcy in my life routines. \n",
      "\n",
      "it will literally be a fresh start, next january \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah exactly, nose to the grind\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah too many bad habits from the pandemic and social isolation. Excessive procrastination, not working out much, eating pattern is bad, sleep pattern is bad, etc.  \n",
      "\n",

      "Thank you. I am getting better as each day brings me closer to the first exam. I am actually catching up and I feel guilty of myself for the bad habits and not doing the courses as well as I should but just at the end, I feel like I am getting a grip on it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for your advice\n",

      "Yes, how the pandemic will play out mostly.\n",
      "I guess we are all in the same boat\n",
      "I think that definitely plays into it. I want to be informed, but not diluged.\n",
      "How do you comfort yourself that it's not that bad?\n",
      "Thanks for your insights. It is helpful to talk it out.\n",
      "Now is the time to focus and be disciplined. \n",
      "I will take your advice.\n",
      "Yes, the short days are a major depressant\n",

      "\n",
      "pretty much being social isolated due to the pandemic, trying to finish up my studies at the same time, and what's going on in the world with regards to the pandemic. My physical and mental health aren't great, and I am not eating as well as I should or sleeping as well as I should.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess we all go through that in different ways with the pandemic now\n",
      "\n",
      "yes sure, I chat with my friend everyday on the phone and that helps to talk about each other's day and my thoughts and feelings, observations with the world etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work. Then it's a vicious circle in which the next day I wake up late, and my day starts late, and so to get as much done, I repeat the same damaging cycle. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I am having real trouble breaking this pattern. And because I work once or twice a week and not during the day, I don't even have the\n",
      " motivation or need to wake up early. \n",
      "I go out only for personal errands and that's once every week or two weeks. I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking. \n",
      "\n",
      "My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "exactly. I understand your feelings too on that. \n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of selfish people inviting others indoors or going out, even a few months ago when the cases were just dropping and they didn't take enough time to wait but immediately lift their own restriction and go out. \n",
      "\n",
      "But even when there were a lot of cases, there are some people on my floor that walked freely in and out many times in one day when\n",
      " it wasn't safe for anyone. And I didn't get that at all and that was when I was angry and anxious of their actions. \n",
      "Because that risked my safety too \n",
      "\n",
      "sorry to hear that you have similar repetitions. That's how it feels. Everyday is the same. And when I talk with my folks on the phone, I have nothing new to share except about the pandemic, because that's the only thing new, and I only call the once a week. \n",
      "\n",
      "But yes, I do believe that it will pass at some point. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah that's why I told myself early on I am doing this for everyone and I couldn't compromise no matter what. Perhaps too stringent but that was my thinking. \n",
      "\n",
      "And it's better now and I am kind of used to this endless cycle. I used to feel even lonelier and claustrophobic. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I see. Well I do hope and it does sound like you are adapting to this well so far and staying sane. So that's good\n",
      "\n",
      "And what sucks even more is that my city is just beginning its second wave as of about two weeks ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it's just starting to ramp up\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I agree. Just stay strong. And one thing I told myself is that years from now I can imagine myself in that future time and thinking back to a dark, bad year, and say and think to myself that I got through it and that there was an end to the dark tunnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that there is an end to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that did help even though the future may be relatively far, I was vividly picturing that emotion of that time in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah good luck to you. And at least your city is deciding to close for the better. My city hasn't even made the call yet even though this is probably the optimal time to do so, early on in the spread where it's controllable. \n",

      "I am sure you will get through this great. We can do it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually talking to you now, I feel renewed hope.\n",

      "It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that.\n",
      "Yes! Exactly and I cannot stand that. I love my routine and predicability.\n",
      "Very much so. If I lose my job I can't pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. In a good economy it took me over 300 applications, 50 interviews, and over 6 months to find a job. \n",
      "I would hope so\n",
      "Right. It's just not something I want to go through again. I just got this job 18 months ago. That job hunting dread and feeling hasn't gone away.\n",

The only problem is I need my job I need a steady income but this person just seems to have it out for me.\n",

Sometimes at night, (and only at night) I get in these super depressive moods and have almost mental breakdowns about everything in my life. But it doesn't happen all the time... only sometime and I don't know why\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Wow yeah I didn't even really think about that... And I'm sure there are ways to get in contact with therapists without having to be face to face? I just like the anonymous aspect of it. I feel like I come across as weak if people see me for me\n",
      "Yeah that's true I have heard of BetterHelp. Maybe I should reach out on one of those platforms when  I feel like I am going into one of my depressive episodes.\n",
      "Oh yeah! That's true! I will try it. And also try to incorporate a better sleep schedule. And that is very helpful thank you. I do live in a small apartment, but I have noticed that when I get out of bed and at least move to the couch, it is a different environment even though it wouldn't seem like it. I never thought how that would help me though. I will totally do it more often when I am slumping\n",

I meant he can't give me emotional support because he's married. There is so time, sex and emotional support he can give. And I don't why you assumed I am a woman because I'm not! Also, I don't think being with Doug is settling! I do however appreciate your time and effort. \n",

      "Yes, my fiance and I are splitting up.\n",

      "A little over 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes exactly, so I feel like I'm starting all over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, I will have time to focus on myself and start anew. But, I am nervous and apprehensive. \n",
      "This is true. I have wanted to start going to the gym more and start doing more yoga.\n",
      "Thank you. I also need to start looking for a new apartment. I am staying with a friend for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been hard with the pandemic, but luckily I have a good friend and she's not rushing me out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I feel like it had an impact on my relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel drained, honestly. I'd love to talk about my current dilemma in my friend circle.\n",
      "Basically. This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid. Any friend i've ever had has just used me for SOME gain. Whether that be boredom, money, or an emotional support pillow. I'm so sick of it. They'll literally ignore me for months and randomly text me for money. If i respond theyll read my messages then ignore me until they need money again. Or, they'll use me to throw alllll their problems onto me and never do the same for me. In some way shape or form- every person I become friends with uses me and throws me away when theyre done. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I feel like it must be me. Maybe i',m annoying? This happens so often the common denominator is ME. But i'm friendly, im assertive, im out spoken, im kind. I don't LET people walk all over me but it seems like that;s all I attract. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty much. it just happens every single time. It's kind of discouraging and just makes me an angry person\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of them. The others I never even get a chance because they just ignore my existence anytime I try and reach out to talk. I've just been waiting for them to pour their problems onto me or have the nerve to ask for money. Then i'll tell them. I already know they won't respond but atleast ill say my peace\n",
      "\n",
      "No. Whenever I do get to say my peace, i'll just cut contact completely. Lately i've been holding it in and just barely responding if at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've told one of them that i have no money and she hasn't contacted me since. But if she tries again i'll say something about the issue. I don't like feeling used. Who even has the nerve to blatantly use somebody like that? It's irritating \n",
      "\n",
      "Agreed. I just hope that one day I can meet people and form actual friendships with them\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I did. My husband and I made a couple friends. Theyre a couple and so are we so we go on double dates but they seem more drawn to him. Me and the other girl got very close and then boom she randomly decided she only wants to talk to me when shes mad or bored\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah it seems that way. Most people like him more than me and it's weird because he sucks at socializing and doesn't even like them that much\n",
      "\n",
      "It just doens't make sense but that's just the way the ca\n",
      "rds were dealt\n",
      "That's actually a great idea! I guess i don't know myself well enough or have any distinct hobbies that would draw me to anybody in particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been great talking with you! \n",
      "\n",
      "hello\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe we are supposed to talk about my description\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing really\n",
      "\n",
      "I only stated the incident with my friend\n",
      "\n",
      "How are you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay are you female or male? or how do you identify?\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask because i would want to hear your opinion on why girls pick unecessary fights for no reason with their friends \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh that is great\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice to make your acquaintance\n",
      "\n",
      "Really? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not understand the insecurities in this case \n",
      "\n",
      "Few months ago she picked a fight with another of our friend for no reason\n",
      "\n",
      "Now its my turn \n",
      "\n",
      "And for some reason when this happens she expects you to come crawling asking her what you did wrong when infact you did nothing. she would start recalling what happened 5years ago\n",
      "\n",
      "I really do not know or understand how she processes things \n",
      "\n",
      "She recently had a baby and we where fine through out the pregnancy stretch, up untill the last month she stopped responding to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "the baby will be months soon and no word from her\n",
      "\n",
      "Its actually disgusting how a grown up continuously\n",
      " act like a child \n",
      "Initially it got me worried, however, knowing her and the childish behavior as always I\n",
      " felt more disgust this time cos i would think a now mum would behave better\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes well not in that order.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sent her a message on her birthday. thats the least i can do. Like im over it tolerating the bad attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly right now i do not miss having her in my life and that is sad because we have been friends for over 1\n",
      "5years.\n",
      "I guess i just git tired of managing the Nonsense from her. So now i'm indifferent and bare think about her\n",
      "\n",
      "I know right\n",
      "\n",
      "You have been helpful by just listening and giving your 2cents\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much\n",
      "\n",
      "Im sure i will. I just aint too out for many friends so i limit my circle and carry people along\n",
      "\n",
      "thank you. Hope you have a good Thanks giving celebration\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm good thanks but pretty frustrated too be honest. It's my friend who has taken to being a pain on Facebook\n",
      "\n",
      "He's all of a sudden got an opinion on everything and tries to pull me into arguments with other friends.\n",
      "That is true yes. It's like the world has to listen to his opinion and only his matters and he won't listen to reason. It's very frustrating and it makes me not want to talk to him. My eyes literally roll when I see a post from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely and I'm not sure how to broach this with him. I actually feel like it is damaging his reputation. \n",
      "Other friends of ours feel the same way. Not sure what to do?\n",
      "That's correct. He is actually a close friend and I wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually I've never thought of it like that. Perhaps a couple of us can have a conversation with him in person. Honestly some off his views are disgusting. I think this needs to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes that's good advice, I think we need to be tactful and raise it in the right way. Have you ever experienced something like this with a friend yourself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok sure please do\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah that's useful. I think you are right in that the ambiguity of social interaction online makes him more inclined to say extreme thinks, perhaps to get a reaction. The more I think about it, perhaps this could be an indication that there is something he is dealing with and may be lashing out.\n",
      " \n",
      "Yeah I think that's definitely the way forward. Listen this has really helped so thanks for the suggestions and sharing your own experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope so too. Nice to talk to you and thanks again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Hi there\n",
      "\n",
      "Not bad but I'm just getting fed up with work. working for a big corporate just bored me to tears. It's all I know and I feel trapped like I can't escape. I don't want this to be my life for ever!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's all the politics of working in an office, the endless meetings and the people trying to get one over on each other. I find it draining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you had a similar experience?\n",
      "It does indeed, actually it's like you work in my office. I'm just fearful that if I try something new I won't be able to support myself financially, do you know what I mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a very good question. I hadn't thought  about it like that. I think I want to try something new and you have helped me realise this. I don't think I actually want to be happier in my current position. The question is how should I approach it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think maybe consider what I actually enjoy and how could I make that profitable.\n",
      "I think maybe I could do something on the side while I'm still working until I'm sure of what I want to so. Finding time with a family and a full time job is hard though. That's why so many people get trapped.\n",
      "Do you think it's even possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "At least that's positive. I need to do something about this because I think it's starting to affect my mental health!\n",
      "\n",
      "That's true actually. Yes that's how I feel right now. You get it. It's like I'm part of a meaningless machine. I think I'm definitely going to do something about it now.\n",
      "Thanks for your input today it has helped\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that should definitely be a priority. Does this actually add meaning? You too and take care\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been better to be honest. I think I need to break up with my girlfriend but she moved in last year and I don;'\n",
      " know how to approach it. I think I'm going to be in for a bad emotional time\n",
      "It's a bit of a mix. I don't find her attractive that much any more and I think that's important. Also since moving in she is difficult to live with. I can't see myself with her long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's good that you have had a similar experience and understand what I'm going through. We dated for a while. The thing is she is Italian and has moved countries to live with me. I feel so bad that this has happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes that's right, I helped her get a job and thought I'd just see how it goes. Her family loves me and thinks I'm great which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about things yes but she sees it as a bit of a joke I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she\n",
      "\n",
      "she's safe etc\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!\n",
      "\n",
      "That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience. \n",
      "Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!\n",
      "\n",
      "I must say, you have been fantastic to talk to about this, we have had a similar experience so I think the advice is coming from experience. Thanks for that!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for a great conversation. To continue as is wouldn't be fair on her and I see that now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I need to put myself first but also be considerate of her feelings. Thanks for that\n",
      "\n",

We were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. We haven't really talked since then. The problem is I'm open to something in the future but I don't know that they are and I can't find the courage to ask\n",
      "\n",

      "Pretty much... but the dumb thing about that is I am the one who broke it off. I was with him since beginning of high school, and so I never knew anything other than him. But Earlier this year I was having second thoughts and thought we should try new things for a while. In the beginning, I was doing fine and he was having a really hard time. But now I miss him more than anything and he is now better off without me\n",

      "Yeah exactly\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I've looked and thought about it, but there's no way of really knowing unless I try them out. I could always try a new job while keeping my current one and decide which one is better, but then I would be overworking myself and more stressed I think\n",

      "yeah I guess different factors, just self isolation for months due to the pandemic, and nearing the end of my studies and experiencing that final last-minute crunch with studying and assignments. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am more stressed and anxious than anything, and not really depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes that's right. The plate issue is more to do with my studies now than the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the pandemic is adding to my anxiety and fear of the outside world \n",
      "\n",
      "especially when I have to go out everytime for errands and personal admin.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes I am. I preferred the old-school way. I've completed university before and it's much better to do things in-person. My online studies have been in place even before the pandemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just finishing up with courses and catching up with last minute stuff \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like so little time when in fact I had loads of time for the last few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just seem to think and do things slower and more distracted\n",
      "\n",
      "like time is moving on so quickly and there's so little hours in the day but I feel that I don't do enough in a day with my school, kind of distracted or wasted time and then when I do something, I look at the time and am sometimes surprised at how much time had actually elapsed when it felt like I didn't do much. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think this has to do with the pandemic at the start of the year and that changed my momentum and rhythm in life and coupled with social isolation, which puts a damper on my studying mentality, I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spend tons of time at home nowadays. I try to surf the net and read up on stuff, and that takes a lot of my time, and kind of aimless, and what I would say is procrastination. I work out from time to time, but not as much as I used to before the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to set aside hobbies and things to develop, like writing during the pandemic, and improve on that skill, but I never got to do that. And now so many months have gone by, and all that's on my mind and plate now are my studies, because it's like I do things slower and leave it till the last minute, even though I know I can pass, but just not as good a mark as I would have liked and not my usual work and study ethics from before. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah not only a complete circle but to me, it's like an aimless road to nowhere, and it goes on and on and repeats day after day \n",
      "\n",
      "that's how it felt for the last few months\n",
      "\n",
      "and everyday is the same and at home, and only two months ago I started working in a new part-time position and that got some normalcy back and less stress and alleviated unpredictability with the economy for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "stuck for sure. It still amazes me that it's november and not march, because it still feels like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "and nowhere as festive, fun, and alive as last november. It's a huge change\n",
      "\n",
      "it feels nothing special, and not normal, and not even like a real november, you know? It's like even if it's christmas, I wouldn't ackowledge it's christmas even though it is, because of the changes and we can't do the things w\n",
      "e used to do. \n",
      "hopefully, scientists can study all these phenomena and our physiological, social, and mental responses to the pandemic. There will be so much that can be learned from all this, I feel. \n",
      "\n",
      "And it's worse because I live by myself so don't have someone here. But I do talk on the phone with my friend daily about things and that does help a lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah like for me, I am not able to fly back to visit my folks this year, and this is the first time\n",
      "\n",
      "And I feel bad about it but nothing I can do\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah anyways, thanks for listening and understanding. I appreciate your input very much. \n",
      "\n",
      "It does help for me to vent I guess and for someone to listen \n",
      "\n",
      "I am good to go now \n",
      "\n",
      "thanks a lot for your help\n",
      "\n",

      "Hi there\n",
      "\n",
      "Things are okay, a little bit of anxiety about my job, but good for the most part\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, sure. I work in an industry heavily impacted by COVID-19, and my company has announced pay cuts as well as potential layoffs starting next year if things don't improve soon\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. Self care is going well, I make sure to take walks every day and spend time with family\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks! I appreciate it. Just chatting with someone and getting some positive reinforcement helps. COVID-19 has given me a lot of anxiety in general, I haven't left the house except to grocery shop since March, and we've got some family members who take it a lot less seriously than we do and are asking us to go over for the holidays\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a lot of anxiety in general, but trying to stay positive helps. And the recent news about the vaccines also help!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for listening :) I appreciate you cheering me on\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, spending a lot more time at home with my fiance has helped us grow closer. And I'm in very good physical shape because of all the walking, exercising\n",
      ", and self care, so that's good!\n",
      "Haven't had much happen today, but I did make myself a great lunch. And my cooking skills have gotten a lot better during the pandemic!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for the chat, I'm in a much better mood now than I was before!\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong one :)\n",

      "Thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands.\n",
      "Thank you. I think since the pandemic it's gotten worse. It's hard to find the \"reason\" to go about my day.\n",
      "I graduated in the spring but haven't been able to find a job because of what's going on, so that's been tough. My wife works from home though.\n",
      "What about you?\n",
      "Very true!\n",
      "\n",
      "I try to keep a routine with exercise and cooking, things like that. Going outside for walks...\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh that's great!\n",
      "\n",
      "That's true. Very good points. It's hard to find a purpose right now because I'm unable to find work. When I started going to school I certainly wasn't expecting any of this to be happening (obviously). I waited until my 30s to go to college so I feel angry that all of this is happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am doing okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a little stressed out this holiday season.\n",

      "Well my husband recently got his hours cut and we are struggling\n",
      "Yes i am worried that i wont be able afford my childrens christmas presents\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes same here. I have three children under the age of 6 so they are still in the innocent stage\n",
      "Unfortunately no i am not good terms with my family.\n",
      "We have been trying for a couple months but nothing seems to work.\n",
      "I try to do work from home and i need be here for my youngest.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes,finances have especially been very tight\n",
      "\n",
      "It is,have you ever encountered such a situation in your life?\n",
      "\n",
      "How did you snap out of the situation,did you have some savings?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes,i have been researching a lot too but it is difficult given that i have been surviving on the savings i had.Also it is very difficult to get a loan currently.\n",
      "Yes,i have two children,5 and 9 year olds\n",
      "\n",
      "That is very helpful of you.I have been wandering all over the internet lost and not knowing where to find help from.I will definitely check this out and make good use of them.Did you also get any funds from anyone?\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree that God is our ultimate guide and helper in all this.He will never forsake us no matter what.I will definitely turn to him at this time to seek for his guidance and with faith He will see me through.\n",
      "\n",
      "True,you have been very helpful and i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me\n",

      "Hello\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess my day is going fairly well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just got some bad news and its got me down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I was given a promotion at my job to take a supervisor position. The only thing that my supervisor needed from me was my 12th grade transcripts, and I'm having a hard time getting them.\n",
      "They have given me a total of 3 weeks and I wasn't able to accomplish it .So they had to go with someone else.\n",
      "So it pretty much has me down, because my other co-workers were looking for me to step up and i feel that I've let them down.\n",
      "Yes I've tried asking the administration office and they said since its been over 10 yrs that those files are stored in another building. They went to the building and wasn't able to find it. So at this point my hands are tied and I'm screwed.\n",
      "I've done that but so many people look up to me and its just hard to for me to be there on a daily basis knowing that I had this big opportunity and that I want be able to fulfil.\n",
      "Are you saying that I do have other methods? But they have already moved forward with another candidate. \n",
      "Yes that's who I contacted at the beginning of my search\n",
      "Thats true in some aspect \n",
      "I believe that's the only positive part dealing with this situation, \n",
      "Ive been a mentor 3 years out of 3 1/2 years Ive been with company\n",
      "Thats a good ideal ill think about doing that. Thanks for your advice\n",
      "Thats it have a blessed day\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a bit bad honestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been struggling with depression for a while. It's hard to deal with. I feel hopeless. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've spoken to a therapist but it didn't help. I tried a help hotline online but they thought I was suicidal so they called the cops to check on me .. never doing that again lol. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what to do\n",
      "\n",
      "I have in the past. Recently, no. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just feel like I'll never be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it didn't help because I'm a bit shy. Or because I didn't know where to start. It's hard to know what to talk about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess it also didn't help because she seemed like she was just reading a script. She wasn't the greatest at making me feel cared about\n",
      "\n",
      "You're doing pretty good though haha\n",
      "\n",
      "I think therapy could work. Actually something happened with my therapist (maybe fired lol) and she's no longer my therapist.. so I need a new one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think my closest friend has been to therapy. I could always ask her for a recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I look out for eachother. I think they're a good help :)\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a nice little chat! You should actually volunteer for a helpline haha\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm ok! I got my friends and family. I made an appointment with my psychiatrist to get different medication so I could ask him for a therapist recommen\n",
      "dation as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm good. Thank you though! This was nice :)\n",
      "\n",
      "You too! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! How are you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Friends and our relationships amongst one another. Two are arguing and I want to help both. We only can facetime each other because of Corona and it is taking a toll among our group.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it's exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend\n",
      " is raging over this which she should. trust was broken.\n",
      "I believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful\n",
      "How do I help them?\n",
      "\n",
      "The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more-so trying to help my other friend, not betray her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want one friend to know that the other was trying to hel and nothurt, but did not think clearly when deciding where to get help from.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I make her understand this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks! What should I say to her?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this can be good because she IS a little hot headed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goos advice!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I will tell everyonr in our circle to fall back and let her come to us when she is ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knws this but nonetheless feels violated. I think your first piece of advice is great though. I will use this and Thanks! Have a good one.\n",
      "Hello every since I lost my job I have felt sad and useless\n",
      "Application after application I get rejected, it makes it hard to even fill out more\n",
      "It feels good someone else knows how frustrating and what a cycle it creates but I am also sorry that you do know how it is also. \n",
      "Thank you for that, it seems most of the jobs I am applying for I am over qualified for which doesn't make sense to me and makes me think it is something personal about me.\n",
      "Hopefully I find an employer that sees a quality workforce over other things, its getting pretty discouraging \n",
      "\n",
      "I seem to be getting blocked at application level for employment, it seems my skills are mostly being put out to contract work now, which is not something I am familiar with. \n",
      "Wow I have never thought about that! That sounds awesome and like it would be great help, also trying something new would feel nice instead of filing the same stuff into applications!\n",
      "My spirits are going up just having this conversation and looking forward to the community outreach. Hopefully it helps lift this gloom that has been over me for months. I loved my previous job but due to bad management it was taking a toll on everyone employed.\n",
      "I think that is truly when I started feeling down, productivity was high but it mattered not to those in charge it was never enough. \n",
      "Thank you so much for talking, I feel so much better already and this was great adivce.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry you had to experience something similar by the sounds of it you are no longer in that situation, so that gives me hope for myself!\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "Feeling pretty down to be honest.\n",
      "I'm just really lonely. My friends are all very busy lately and I haven't been able to find a partner for a long time.\n",
      "Yes. Normally it's not so bad but it's been such going on for such a long time. It's harder to deal with after so many years.\n",
      "Yes, but the biggest part is not being able to find romantic partner.\n",
      "Part because of my low income and part because of my age. I live in a college town and most single women are 10 years younger than me.\n",
      "I've tried but my friends don't have very large social circles and most mutuals are already dating or are not interested in dating anyone at all. \n",
      "Internet dating is a cost issue, the most popular apps charge to meet the person, I could look at singles nights once the Covid issue is over. I don't even know if there are any locally.\n",
      "I hear that from people. I wish I had Covid as an excuse instead of just being confused about why I can't find someone.\n",
      "Possibly, I can see how that is possible.\n",
      "Well I appreciate the advice and support.\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "Hello. I am so broken up and also disgusted from my break-up with my only long-term partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so surprised by the hurtful things he said when we broke up I just don't know how to even manage my feelings about all the time we spent together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I suppose for him it came out of nowhere. But for me I just had slowly come to the realization that he was not the person for me. I fell out of love with him slowly and grew more annoyed by a lot of his behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me we were fighting a lot, and about dumb stuff like whether or not a salad is a meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I realized that we were fighting so much because I wanted him to eat healthier and be healthier and he was not going to change and it wasn't even right for me to change him if he didn't want help.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I am sure he felt attacked and unattractive and so he lashed out at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I did the right thing, not just for me but for him. It isn't fair to keep dating someone just because being single is hard. \n",
      "I just still get weird lingering feelings wondering if he was right and maybe I am too much for a lot of people. I don't think he is right, and my friends disagree but it still hurts and I can still hear him tell me no one would ever love me.\n",
      "No, I don't think I have any regrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah? I suppose people just say things when they are hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. Hopefully someone who doesn't fight over whether salad is valid dinner choice! \n",
      "\n",
      "haha yeah!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah. I think things will work out eventually. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, you are a really supportive listener.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi.  I'm doing fine.  Just feeling a bit anxious.\n",
      "Well, I am retired, but in need of extra income to meet my financial obligations.  It is very difficult for me, however, to wear a mask for longer than a few moments.  Due to the mandates in my area, I would be required to wear a mask.\n",
      "That is what I am currently doing, and it is helping some.  I have increased the time I work on there, so that will help some.  I would love a second source as well, however...just so I could really save some.\n",
      "Yes, I have thought of that, actually.  I have quite a few items I would love to sell.  I have never done it, though, so need to research how to ship items, etc.  \n",
      "Well, I will definitely have to check that out.  It would serve two purposes : decluttering and making money.  I think I got anxious last week when I had a tire go flat and took my car in to get it fixed.  I found out I need all new tires and new brakes.  Not easy on a fixed income.  Plus I am widowed.\n",
      "I actually don't. Only to the grocery store, or to visit my daughter who lives about 20  minutes away.\n",
      "I am not on any medication, which I am so thankful of.  I have not checked any programs for assistance.  I'm not sure if I would even qualify.  It wouldn't hurt to try, I guess.\n",
      "That is so true!  I have been selling some items through my neighborhood online Marketplace and made $100 just this week.  I have also started a change jar.  Amazing how a bit here and there can add up.\n",
      "Yes.  I am definitely one not to give up, which is a good thing!  I appreciate your help.  I feel more positive now.\n",
      "Thank you very much.  I hope you have a blessed day.\n",

      "\n",
      "I agree! I've also been turning to drugs a lot lately due to the situation. Procrastinating makes me feel guilty, and I end my day too early to smoke and focus my mind on something other than studying....\n",
      "\n",
      "Hm, I think it has less to do with liking or disliking, and more with starting a very hard and lengthy degree online without any social contact\n",

      "It is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don't act on because you are married. \n",
      "Yes i see that. No nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn't be as exact for the type of person that I do not talk to because of his reservations about it.\n",
      "That is what I feel. I am not talking to him. I had to the other day to get in contact with someone(medical emergency) but do not call just to chat and catch up. I even unfriended him. I just want to comfort him over it but I think it is best just to never speak of him again. \n",

      "That is why I brought it up.\n",

      "The company I work for is winding down. i'm on the old side to be looking for a job and i'm likely going to have to accept a lower salary, a longer commute and a heavier workload.

      "I started looking for a job last week. I had a transition meeting today to pass on the little bit of my work that will be left to another person. I have 2 children; one who just started college this fall and another who is a junior in high school. my elderly mother lives with me also so I can't sell my house any time soon and move into something smaller and cheaper.

      "No I haven't reached out to anyone besides family, but that might be a good idea, getting a professional to help me out with some options \n",
      "Yeah, I do most of my searching online, but maybe it's where I've been going that hasn't been helping much. Do you have any suggested websites or apps I could try out?\n",
      "That's a good idea, yeah I think I really need more options out there. But I do like your idea of talking to a professional or career counselor, maybe they'll be able to help me in more ways than I can help myself. I'm definitely going to try that!\n",
      "No, that's all right. Thanks for the suggestions, you've been really helpful, I'm going to try some of those out! \n",

      "Thank you for asking. I'm feeling very overwhelmed at the moment. My depression and the weight of everything is getting on top of me.\n",
      "Well, the depression has been there as long as I can remember. It fluctuates. But the last few days have been particularly challenging and it's been difficult to get out of bed in the morning.\n",
      "Yes. I guess it has coincided with an increase in challenging behaviours from my children.\n",
      "Thank you. Yes, he has been helpful today. He took the children to school for me so that I was able to get some things done around the house. \n",
      "It is very challenging as they both have complex special needs. It's hard to find time and energy to operate the household in between.\n",
      "Thank you. Yes, I haven't been out to check on the veggie garden today. That usually gives me an opportunity to calm my mind.\n",
      "Unfortunately, I am not in a position to do so. There is nobody that my son would be comfortable with. But we are trying to implement some respite soon. \n",
      "Most certainly. We try often to explore our natural environment. It can be limiting due to our daughter's physical disability but we manage the best we can to include her.\n",
      "Thank you. I will definitely touch base again with my therapist soon. I have a follow up psychiatrist appointment next month too. In the mean time, I will definitely put some of these things you've recommended in to practice. ☺️\n",
      "You are right. I do need to take care of me. I need to stop feeling guilty for needing to do that.\n",
      "Thank you. Yes, I need to get back in to the Ring Fit adventure on the Switch. It definitely helps my my and body feel stronger.\n",

      "And maybe come back in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just hope I don't see him before I go home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except deep down I wish I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much. You have been kind to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a good rest of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bye bye\n",
      "\n",
      "I am anxious right now about how my family will react when I tell them I'm not coming back for the holidays\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Are you there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the health risks and also the unhealthy emotional environment with my family\n",
      "Health risks are primarily the pandemic. Covid-19 cases have gotten very high where I live and my family members are not very careful.\n",
      "I'm glad you said that. Yes, when I told my family that I wasn't coming, I stated health risks as the reason. But, I am worried that they may insist on me attending as we get closer to the holidays and in some ways I feel guilty because it isn't just the pandemic that makes me not want to go. I usually don't feel great during holidays with my family and I think they are harmful to me overall\n",
      "Yeah, I think people deserve to build whatever home, family, or environment is best for them and shouldn't be judged for it\n",
      "Yes, it made me feel powerful in some way to say no to going to holidays even if it was in the context of the pandemic\n",
      "Thank you for helping me. It feels good to at least talk about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "I just don't feel enthused about anything lately.\n",
      "Just kind of \"blah.\"\n",
      "I don't know that I have exactly lost interest.  I still do them, but somehow it feels like I'm just going through the motions.\n",
      "Not really.  I guess that I'm just kind of stuck in a rut.\n",
      "Yes, I would be, but I'm not sure that it actually needs to be a new hobby.  I just need to have some sort of project that I'm working on.\n",
      "No!  I've got a jigsaw puzzle that I could start, and I also have a list of \"21 books that you've been meaning to read.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If I start working through the 21 books, that should keep me going for quite a while (even if I'm not interested in all of them)!\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for chatting.\n",
      "It was helpful for me to have a chance to put my feelings into words.  It just seems like I haven't had the opportunity to do that recently.\n",
      "I believe that we've successfully completed the task, and I need to go cook dinner.   Goodbyt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been better. I have to give a presentation at work on a stage. This is causing me a lot of stress and problems sleeping\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the thought of getting nervous in front of people and forgetting what I want to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have learned my lines and practiced at home a lot. I know what to say almost word for word but I had a bad experience in the past that has scared me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for understanding, yeah I suppose I could take notes. I think it is being in front of people and looking foolish that I'm scared of the most. I know a lot of people at work and don;t want them to think I'm bad on stage. Can you related to that?\n",
      "Hopefully I can try to get past the nerves, some people make it look easy. I'm usually really confident but something about standing on a stage makes me feel very scared and anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could do I suppose. I won't be the only one presenting that day so I feel like I won't be able to measure up against the other people on stage.\n",
      "Yeah I do have a tendency to be negative sometimes and make a big deal out of things. I should actually focus on the good things. Has this technique helped you in the past?\n",
      "I think that is really good advice. I think I have just suffered from a bad experience in the past and this has shaped my way of thinking to always be fearful. I'm fine in meetings or virtually but something about a stage just scares me.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes I don't want it to hold me back personally or professionally any more\n",
      "\n",
      "hey thanks that really helps\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope so too but in future I'll fake it until I believe it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not feeling great. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me.\n",
      "Yes, I think so although I don't have any proof. Things were going really well and then all of a sudden she text me and told me things aren't working.\n",
      "She has started a new job and I think she might have met someone at work that she likes better than me. I can't believe she is doing this to me!\n",
      "Yes I suppose it is true. The thing is I thought things were going well and she is stressed out at work with her new job but we were getting on great!\n",
      "I haven't thought of it like that before but still I want to talk to her about it not just text me randomly and hint at ending things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay what do you think I should do about it because the text seemed very final? Looks like she has made her mind up already about things. \n",
      "Do you think that she wants to talk rather than end the relationship?\n",
      "That makes sense but it is not what I want to hear. After all we have been through together, we were even talking about getting our own place together and now all that will be for nothing!\n",
      "Yes that's right. I know getting angry doesn't help but I want things to go back to the way they were.\n",
      "Yes that's right but that's what couples do isn't it?\n",
      "I still think there is someone else that has come between us.\n",
      "No I haven't, it is just a feeling.\n",
      "So do you think I should try and talk to her and ask her outright if she has met someone else?\n",
      "I think I do need to calm down a bit and maybe talking to her would be the best way to start. I don;t know what I'd do though if she ended it.\n",
      "Ok well maybe if I show her that I can stay calm and strong then she will stay with me?\n",
      "I suppose I could go into it and listen as you have said, there could be other reasons like the new job or maybe morning in that is causing some of it. I'll try and keep calm but it is hard when emotions run high.\n",
      "That is actually pretty good advice. I hope we stay together and there is nobody else though. \n",
      "Hey thanks for the words of wisdom. Not sure I'll like the chat but I'll try and stay calm.\n",
      "I'm sad and angry because I no longer talk to my best friend\n",
      "Well she was staying at my house for a month and we were constantly fighting so she just stopped talking to me\n",
      "Yes it is and then she began avoiding me while we were in the same house, so we started arguing again and I found out she's been lying to me since I've known her and I'm very upset.\n",
      "I don't think so, my parents think I was too harsh by deciding to end the friendship, it as if my own family doesn't understand. \n",
      "My other friend believed that it wasn't too harsh to end the friendship as they know I value honesty but it makes me feel angry that I was being used for so long and constantly lied to.\n",
      "I really love that quote, it's absolutely true; I think I will talk to my friend about the situation some more so I can fully get over it.\n",
      "Yes, I also realized that I wasn't angry with my friend but rather myself \n",
      "Because I basically allowed her to use me for seven years and kept lying to me or gave her space because I thought I was being a good friend.\n",
      "I feel like I was stupid to do that and soft\n",
      "Thank you very much, I'll continue to talk about the issue with my other friend, I really appreciate your wisdom.  \n",
      "No thank you, enjoy the rest of your day\n",
      "Hi, I'm not doing very well. I feel very depressed.\n",
      "I recently got fired.\n",
      "I guess, I mostly just feel really depressed, like I didn't do a good job. \n",
      "That sounds like a good idea, I could talk to my best friend about this.\n",
      "I think it might help, maybe I won't feel so sad afterward or so useless.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I guess I could say that being fired has made me feel useless and very depressed.\n",
      "Thank you, I think that this might help me.\n",
      "Thank you very much.\n",
      "I think this will really help.\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing alright, thanks. Yourself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Good to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been feeling very down lately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It's very overwhelming. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes and a lot of uncetainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's good to know others feel the way I do. I've been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes with lots of conflicting information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Work, read, exercise. I've been going to the gym more.\n",
      "Thank you. I'm trying. I really don't want to be on medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am trying. I don't want to fall deep down an emotional black hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, my husband is very supportive but I don't want to upset him too much so I don't fully open up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will look into the telehealth. Thank you for that recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will give that a try. Thank you again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello I am here to discuss my anxiety over the current pandemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much for your understanding. Yeah it's tough especially with rising cases for the past two weeks or so in my city. \n",
      "I live in Canada and my city is pretty good so far and really low on numbers but have been seeing new cases every day for the last two weeks or so\n",
      "\n",
      "so that adds anxiety to me when I go out and I am more on guard and paranoid \n",
      "\n",
      "And we had a lock-down earlier this year and yet, with the exception of one province, every province remains operational at full speed despite lock-downs earlier, and now a lot of provinces are seeing record cases with the second wave.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah I hope you get through this okay also and stay safe and well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time. \n",
      "\n",
      "And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah I have been adjusting to it and the cases were down and even to zero in my city for most of the last few months, but there's definitely the start of a new community spread now. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "yes correct\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as I used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (I sleep a lot later than I should). \n",
      "\n",
      "So I am disappointed in myself to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive\n",
      "\n",
      "now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year. \n",
      "\n",
      "yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening. \n",
      "\n",
      "We won't know more about the mental implications and the sociological aspects of the pandemic probably until years to come. \n",
      "\n",
      "I thought about that\n",
      "\n",
      "to the gym, I certainly would. Because it's indoors and I do feel it's unsafe as there are many equipment that others could touch. Running I felt that way because the path that I usually run on is narrow and other people walk through it also. However, I did have second thoughts about that when the case numbers were down. But I finally decided to keep doing it and stick to all outdoor trips for essential business. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "but that's just me, and I know we all have different personalities, preferences, and tolerances of risks and acceptances, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "so in my opinion, I feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So I just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when I could have done that anytime I wanted. \n",
      "\n",
      "black and white thinking...let me think \n",
      "\n",
      "for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah exactly. Because people are being selfish and are subjecting others to risks even if they don't care about themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "but I know I am pretty extreme in my thinking. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really love the outdoors and I go out pretty often before the pandemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "But it's just that my own thinking is rigid and made up about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell. \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah I understand your thinking with the grey areas as well. I suppose for this case, it's all black and white for me, no grea areas or compromises.\n",
      "\n",
      "that's good analysis by the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But anyhow I am good to go then. Thank you so very much for understanding and for your valuable inputs. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's a fascinating area though, fascinating thinking. I am also curious on the social and mental implications of this in the long-run\n",
      "\n",
      "but only time will tell\n",
      "\n",
      "there will be so much research and books written about our times. \n",
      "\n",
      "well I do a lot of \"waste\" at home. So I am quite sluggish and lazy and lost at home. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am productive but not as driven or productive as before at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "for sure yeah. I am sure we can get through all this in one piece eventually.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was thinking this also that even though this is a very tough time, we will look back on this about years from now, and say wow, we got through all that!\n",
      "\n",
      "no no I am okay thanks for asking\n",
      "\n",
      "I am just kind of spelling in out the details of my thinking and how my life has been so far\n",
      "\n",
      "I am actually okay\n",
      " so no worries\n",
      "yup. Exactly. Lost time can always be made up later. \n",
      "\n",
      "okay then. I am good to go. Thanks again and thank you for your input. It does help to just kind of vent in a way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah for sure\n",
      "\n",
      "I worked out a little bit before I started the chat. I am also doing some online courses on my own time. So I will keep working hard on those. And I hope to get back more into the routine of working out. I really do think it helps my mood if I just make more time and motivation for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you seem intelligent and analytical also and you know what I mean. So I do appreciate your time and input\n",
      "\n",
      "thanks. I hope you best of luck then with all your endeavours. I know we can all get through this time. Thank you. \n",
      "\n",
      "stay well and stay safe my friend\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you and all the best. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't take it anymore the stress from my parents.  They don't acknowledge I am doing my best.\n",
      "It's so hard to not get the affirmation that I am doing a good job.\n",
      "They don't say that I made the best choices I could given the circumstances.\n",
      "I want to cry every time they talk to me.  I don't know how to communicate any better what I'm feeling.\n",
      "What can I do to please them?\n",
      "When my children started getting in trouble at school\n",
      "That would maybe help.  I have to see maybe they could help me with solving the situation.\n",
      "I see your point.\n",
      "Yes, maybe my sister could help.  She has children too.  \n",
      "Thanks so much for the help.\n",
      "No thanks\n",
      "You have been of great help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks so much.\n",

      "I loved physics and I decided to attend university, but soon after I slowly lost my interest and became unmotivated\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually the professors and the class atmosphere was the reason, and of course the quality of teaching\n",
      "\n",
      "so I started to skipping the classes and failing\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes lots of stress and pressure. I did not, because we didn't have such things or at least I wasn't aware\n",
      "\n",
      "But nobody even pointed that why I'm failing, they just didn't care\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved physics a lot more than now, but what's the point of studying when the teachers are pulsing you not to study! (because of the quality of teaching)\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope there was someone, but I don't think we have a counselor\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, same with me! I wish I could attend a better univeristy\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't have another choice but this\n",

      "I do worry a lot.  If he would commit fully to me that would help perhaps.  If he never cheated again but I don't know if he can do that reliably.\n",
      "I think marriage, but then again if he cheats then what commitment is that really if it ends in divorce?\n",
      "That's a good point you make.  I was lonely and wanting to fill that void.  But, I do want a family.  I'm just not sure he is that committed or even mature enough to handle this responsibility. Perhaps I'm naive.\n",
      "Thanks for the encouragment.  \n",

Nothing like feeling the person who is paid to help you refusing to talk to you\n",

      "I feel like he didn't help at all. Up to that point we mostly just talked about politics or whatever. I'm a charity patient, he get's paid through the organization, but because of my financial difficulties, I'm not paying. I think he saw that as a shortcoming on my part.\n",

I told him it feels like I'm walking a tightrope and he's suggesting I get rid of the safety net without giving me something else, some other way to cope. He said that's not what a therapist is supposed to do and that my resistance shows I don't really want to change.\n",

I have only been able to do it successfully once, at the meditation gardens when I visited my son in San Diego some years back.

The sad side of it is that I probably will never know what I did wrong for things to end like that. Maybe I didn't do anything wrong.

      "yes that's good advice. I have done it but sometimes I overdo my rewards like take too long of a break, etc.\n",

I'm fine if people aren't responsive to my personal ideas, but as far as a work situation - or any situation where there are pre-agreed situations that must be dealt in certain ways - that is frustrating.  I think I expect too much  from people - but really my expectations aren't that high, I don't think - if I really think about it.\n",

      "Thank you. That seems helpful. I tend to make excuses for myself when I feel like this and allow myself to slip in other areas of my life. For example if I am stressed, I tend to eat unhealthy food. Overall its hard to juggle all things I want to do and be at once. I will plan to make a list and check off some small things. \n",

      "I'm so sorry that it's a situation that you can relate to, its such a hard situation watching someone drink their life away no matter what you do until they eventually pass away from it. I can say my anxiety has increased immensely as well as depression. It seems that quite a bit of pressure has been placed on me because of the family business she ran and my dad who is now trying to live without her.\n",
      "It definitely does, I know it feels like quite a bit now but will gradually become easier to deal with. \n",

      "Very true, especially someone who is willing to listen and provide advice or positive conversation.\n",
      "Yes, I have begun a new medication that will hopefully help soon, I have also begun focusing on different hobbies that I enjoy so that I can keep my mind busy.\n",

      "Yes, not sure if I will ever be married again.   \n",
      "I wish you the best.  Keep your head up and look to the future.   Bye.\n",
      "Make sure you seek a couselor if needed.   I had to go for 6 months to get my head straight.\n",
      "Hi. How are you?\n",
      "I’ve been better. Feeling somewhat down. \n",
      "I’ve been stressed out lately. I recently lost my job. \n",
      "The uncertainty I guess. Especially during these times, I’m not sure how soon I will be able to find a job. \n",
      "I’ve been trying to keep busy. Exercising, reading and spending time with family. \n",
      "I’ve been looking for employment also. \n",
      "Not yet. I’m just going to collect unemployment and clear my head for awhile. \n",
      "I’m rethinking my career. \n",
      "I’m thinking of starting my own business, but anxious about not having a steady income at this point. \n",
      "Any suggestions?\n",
      "That’s not a bad idea. Right my unemployment check is enough, but who knows how long that will last. \n",
      "What do you think?\n",
      "I think I will do some research and see what careers will fit me best. \n",
      "Do you have any suggestions?\n",
      "Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up (all to be done at the end of this and the next month)\n",
      "\n",
      "Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won't do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up. \n",
      "\n",
      "so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It's on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that's one method I have used. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for your trust in me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "true, very true. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for sympathizing and understanding. \n",
      "\n",
      "ok. That's true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it's best to get it out of one's reach for best results. \n",
      "\n",
      "Timer, great idea. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "ok, I will employ these methods more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for sharing these.\n",
      "\n",
      "then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious. \n",
      " \n",
      "Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books\n",
      "\n",
      "and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation. \n",
      "\n",
      "yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down. \n",
      "\n",
      "so yes, the second wave is here it seems (belatedly), but hopefully it doesn't get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now\n",
      "\n",
      "so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and I also have to write my exam outside of my home. \n",
      "\n",
      "ok. I could look into that. I work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year. \n",
      "\n",
      "yes and I have been and will continue to do that. \n",
      "\n",
      "But aside from these stressors, I think I have a better idea now on how I should proceed, starting today \n",
      "\n",
      "not that I haven't, but just with more renewed faith and having fresh priorities in my head. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "yes thank you very much for listening and understanding with my issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "your input has been helpful and it does help for me to kind of vent out on what has been bothering me\n",
      "\n",
      "yes so true. Thank you for that. \n",
      "\n",
      "alright then. I will continue my day from here then. Thanks again, and good luck with your endeavours!\n",

      "Hello, I am taking two courses online now that are nearing their end, one at the end of november, and one at the end of December. I guess I am just scared and stressed out about not doing well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I see. My problem right now is that due to the pandemic and having a lot of time to myself and getting restless, I tend to waste a lot of time doing other things, and procrastinating. So I am catching up and I know I can finish them, but just that I could have done better, so there's an element of guilt and shame involved because I am not happy with my actions on how I handled my studies. \n",
      "\n",
      "No, not yet. It's distance education so it's mostly me studying on my own time (each course runs at a max duration of six months), but I have reached out to them regarding some assignment and exam questions. \n",

      "But I do appreciating your sympathetic tone and that you've gone through this also. \n",
      "\n",
      "And also I go through things slower and things become more sluggish and not really motivated, whereas before I was faster and more productive and really interested in learning and trying to finish assignments etc as quick as I can, and not take the full 6 months of course deadline. \n",
      "\n",
      "I see. I do see a problem and just last week I kind of started to prioritize things and take things more seriously, as the deadlines wind down. I am a little behind schedule, but not severely. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "yes I do that too. I understand what you mean. The problem with me is I alternate with relaxation with studying too much, and blurring those lines too much. \n",

      "\n",
      "yes I understand that too. I tend to be more solitary in nature. For me, I talk to my friend for help, a really close friend for advice and my troubles. But most of the time, I get through these logistical and existential problems myself.

      "\n",
      "Well, I am starting to hang out with friends more and establish weekly traditions like poker night. So that's definitely helping. The more I can be around others the easier it is for sure. I'm wondering how bad it is to turn to alcohol when I'm in pain.\n",

      "Yes\n",

Right now in my life I'm ready to seek help, but I'm having a lot of anxiety about it because I'm very worried about how others will judge me. I'm worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I've made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. \n",

      "Not really. He just has this one particular friend who comes over sometimes and they lock themselves in the room.\n",
      "I am so scared I don't want to confront him I have always tried to show him how much I trust him as away to make him feel responsible enough\n",
      "Yes. He is my only child and I am single parent \n",
      "Never thought of it that way. That could be a possibility. But he always seems happy and we chat a lot onlythat he his behind closed doors in his room for a long time everyday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Am also concerned about the friend who comes over. I don't really know his family or home just that he's from the neighborhood and they go to the same school.\n",
      "I find reassurance from your words. Its been tough for me this far we have come with my son and I want us to be close even as he growing up to become a young man. I have a good relationship with their teacher and will definitely give her a friendly call to know more from her.\n",

      "Just an average day if I had to describe it. Nothing particularly unusual or bad. Worked for about 8 hours and now no plans for the night\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly. I find that when the night starts seeping in the loneliness comes up especially with no concrete plans or things to keep busy\n",
      "\n",
      "And for me it's the build up to bed time. Those hours to fill with either dinner, watching tv, reading or whatever. Plenty of time let me mind wander and think the worst.\n",

      "From time to time yes. I have a dog so that's nice company\n",
      "\n",
      "Even then I sometimes turn to drinking to clear my mind\n",

      "Yes! Something to make me feel needed and companionship knowing he's depending on me\n",

      "I do. I've been better about reaching out to people and joining a few online groups. It has helped for sure but I still find myself with the feelings from time to time\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That's cute. Fish are less work than dogs but still a way to feel needed with food and water changes\n",
      "\n",
      "That's good to hear. Sometimes I think I'm not doing enough to get help but each meeting or talk with friends is a step in the right direction\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks. Good to hear that even from a stranger. It feels like a bother to burden others with my \"problems\" even though they are supportive \n",
      "\n",
      "Even this was helpful. I was leaning towards pouring that first drink of the night soon, but just a quick chat like this has helped me reframe and stay strong for tonight at least\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, thank you so much. This was a nice chat that definitely helped me. Hope you have a good rest of your night\n",

      "I just feel anxious and sometimes I don't even know why. But yes my mind keeps going. \n",
      "Yes please. Maybe something you did could help me too. Did you also have trouble quieting your mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds like something I could try. Did you just google Tracks to Relax?\n",
      "I have in the past. Is it on Spotify?\n",

      "\n",
      "Probably I will try to listen to a music before the test\n",

      "Yes, because sometimes I see people studying before the test and I don't think it's a good idea due to you will be more anxious\n",

      "Hello. I am sad because my job is not rewarding. It is a dead-end job and I feel shameful anymore. I don't like talking about my job with anyone since it is so pointless.\n",
      "Hi Sharon. I'm Larry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a maintenance supervisor in a manufacturing facility.\n",
      "Yes that is a very good summary of what is going on. And I am glad to see you can relate. While I am lucky to not work in sales since I know those jobs are extremely tough but the lack of reward is all the same.\n",
      "I have not seen anything worth jumping ship for. I am afraid of the old adage of the grass always looks greener from the other side of the fence. Meaning I leave this job and only find a worse job.\n",
      "Unfortunately there are no other positions at the place I work. Yes my boss is very well aware of how unhappy I am. He is also unhappy and has been looking for jobs too. It isn't that great of a place to work at. I have had 3 different friends leave my place of employment, I've just been to lazy to leave too. It's a catch 22, too lazy to leave but due to feeling sad from being here I don't have the energy to try to leave.\n",
      "Yes, I see a psychologist and she does her best to help me but ultimately it is up to me to make the changes I need to in life.\n",
      "I've spoke things over with my boss, he has tried a few things. Currently we are in a holding pattern due to some upper management changes and we are awaiting to see how the new manager would like to run things.\n",
      "I have been slacking on that too. Just don't find pleasure in anything anymore. Now that it is spring time though hopefully that changes. \n",
      "I should start writing lists. I know that is a great tool for helping.\n",
      "Thank you for the encouragement .\n",
      "Thank you for your help Sharon. Have a good day.\n",
      "Hi, I'm struggling today.\n",
      "I just feel worn out with everything I have to do. \n",
      "I don't know what else I can d to help my daughter.\n",
      "My daughter struggles with school work and memory. She learns differently and needs lots of support. I have contacted the school a number of times over the years but never really had any support or acknowledgement from them. I guess it's just an accumulation of things.\n",
      "But what do I now. She's 17 and it's so difficult to give her the time and then  encourage her to tell me when she needs help and for her to be willing to accept it. \n",
      "That is great advice. She does climb and hasn't been able to climb or see her friends with everything closed. I think as she will be able to again soon may be that will help her to relax and get back into it. She does learn through repetition but has lacked enthusiasm especially in the last few months.       \n",
      "She had heart  surgery as a baby so has actually had the vaccine herself as she's in the vulnerable category.  I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study.  \n",
      "What did you do? Her interests are music and photography. Recently she has started a gardening club with the horticulture department at school. She does enjoy her social life well when she has been able to have it. She has had social ups and downs but apart from the epidemic she has been happier than in her earlier years at school. You are right she is becoming an adult and will find her place. At 17 I guess she doesn't have to decide just yet. \n",
      "You have certainly made me feel a bit more positive. \n",
      "Thank you so much for your time and kindness today. You helped me refocus and some of the things you said were just what I needed to hear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.  Take care :-) \n",
      "I used to love my boyfriend, but now I can't stand him. Why has this happened and how to break up with him without hurting his feelings much?\n",
      "I just find him extremely annoying. How he walks, talks, breathes even... I should have walked away from him earlier.\n",
      "He is very respectful, committed, sweet and loving, but I just don't feel anything towards him anymore.\n",
      "Yes, it is.\n",
      "We've been together for 3 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he wants to get married and have children. It makes me anxious. I'm not ready for those things.\n",

      "I don't want him to hate me.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about me? Will I regret breaking up with him? I've became a better person since we've met.\n",
      "I feel guilty to hurt his feelings and at the same time it pisses me off even more!\n",
      "You're right. I should talk about it with him openly and tell him how I really feel.\n",
      "Maybe I'm afraid of being alone. Maybe things could have been different if it weren't for COVID. Maybe we spend TOO much time together.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "To be honest, there are some times when she made me cry or mad when I get home. I think that over the time and the more older I get, the more I would knowledge my relationship with her. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do have other friends that I could purse the relationship farther. I think I just felt bad that I known her for years and she is a good person. It's just not what I need right now. \n",

I know people get all crazy about their kids and sports.  I agree that he's jealous but his daughter isn't really that good - didn't make the school team either.

      "Well, my fiance and I \"sort of\" broke up recently. I moved out of our place and all, but we continued to see each other at least 3X per week. And we both said we're not 100% sure that we're ok with us being done for good. - We promised to tell each other if we start dating anyone. He said he wasn't interested in dating. Three days after that conversation, I come over unexpectedly to find him making dinner for a woman I've never seen before. Turns out it was his 3rd date with her. He met her on a dating app a week before our conversation about promising to tell each other if we start dating others.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, I'd still be hurt if he told me. But now on top of that hurt, I feel disrespected... and everything I thought I knew about him is kind of crushed. We were together 6 years, and I always, ALWAYS believed he was the most honest, kind, \"stand up guy\" I've  ever known.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's true. The worst part is that he doesn't seem to think I have a right to be hurt. How do I even deal with someone who hurt me but doesn't care to take any responsibility whatsoever?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's true. He didn't invite me over. I expected him to be at work that night. I was coming over to see our cats, which still all lived with him. I still had a key and it didn't occur to me that I could invade his privacy since I had been spending 3X a week with him, and he was fine with me using the key. The whole thing was a shock. I wouldn't have come in had I known what I'd find inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah. It's a long story to explain here, but at first he told me it was a first date... then he said it was a second date... then finally he said it was a third date. I had to figure out on my own that he met her through a dating app, which makes me feel extra icky because now I kind of feel like a stalker. (Don't worry, I didn't do anything illegal or immoral to figure this out at all. He left an easy breadcrumb trail for me to follow.... but it still feels gross that I felt compelled to research the situation because I could \"feel\" he was lying.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. I'm not only invested in him. I have a SUPER close relationship with his two daughters. Some of the reason he wanted to see me after our \"break up\" is because he didn't want to tell his daughters that I might be out of their lives forever. He told me so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I love those girls so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're 13 and 16. They were 7 and 11 when I started seeing their dad.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a good suggestion. I think individual therapy might benefit me. I could ask him if he's open to couple's counseling--even if it's over, it could help with closure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do. I appreciate your talking the time to listen to me. Sometimes just talking about an issue can help organize one's feelings and thoughts.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "For a full year--since March 2020, when the pandemic first started. I was working from home just 1 day per week prior to that, which I liked. But I've found that 5 days per week is much too much. I miss people. :( \n",
      "That's where it gets awkward. It seems like everyone besides me are super happy that we'll continue working from home. I hesitate to share my feelings because maybe my manager will change her mind, which would be a big bummer for everyone else on the team (seemingly).\n",
      "Well, it's possible that my manager will say we can be flexible. But if so, I think I'd end up being the only one in my office working... which would be just as lonely as working from home while throwing away the few perks of working from home, like saving on gas. Plus, I think my company will probably want to repurpose our office space eventually.\n",
      "\n",
      "lol, sorry, that was an ugly run-on sentence. :\\\n",
      "\n",
      "That is indeed a possibility. But my office is in a city that has a whole lot of high-tech companies, which were moving towards doing more work from home even BEFORE the pandemic. So it kind of feels like this might be a \"cultural shift\" in my area in general. Although there has GOT to be a whole lot of other people who feel like I do. Maybe we should start our own company, lol.\n",
      " \n",
      "That's a good question. My state is still one of the ones that's mostly shut-down. Part of my depression surely stems from the fact that all evening/weekend activities ended a year ago as well.\n",
      "That's true. And your suggestion of improving my work space is a good one. I've been working in a modified walk-in closet. I've tried to make it inviting, but there are no windows/etc.... it's kind of a dark cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a good thought. My computer is set-up on a folding card table. (I tried finding a desk a while back, but there was a huge shortage since everyone suddenly had to buy them for themselves, kids, etc.). I hadn't thought of asking my company to buy me one. Plus a more comfy chair could improve my attitude.\n",
      "\n",

      "Troubled would not be the word I would use, but it wasn't a car accident. She was hit by a car in the street outside of my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was coming home from school. She is only 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say that I am anxious all the time. She survived, but she had some serious injuries after. I feel like a part of me died that day, the part that thought I could protect her no matter what. I would say that I'm also feeling ashamed because it was out of my control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that how you would feel?\n",
      "\n",
      "thank you for saying that. I quit my job to focus on her healing, and i don't want to go back to work now.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is healing well, she has a moderate TBI (traumatic brain injury) so there is still so much uncertainty. It sucks to blame ourselves for things that happen to our kids. \n",
      "\n",
      "No. And I'm completely dreading going back to work. I wish I could somehow get paid to exist so that I can just stay home with my daughter all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "YES. And if you can figure out how to make that happen I'll give you 10% of the salary lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been looking for a remote part time job that has pay equivalent to a full time job. Apparently, that's not a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's your question.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't have a family. Just my daughter, and my boyfriend who lives in Australia that can't come here due to Covid restrictions. She does see her Dad everyday, but the part time hours I would need would have to be flexible and no company is even really hiring part time at the moment from what I can tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a psychiatrist and a therapist that I have been working with. Their solution is medication which I am extremely against. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you help me?\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not study for a test and I very poorly. I feel ashamed!\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly. I did not try!\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't feel motivated to study\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ok I will do that. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will! I need to put some effort in for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok I will try. I think the problem is not trying for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "great advice. thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's all. I feel better now. I'll try more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be difficult to express feelings. I agree.\n",
      "I work a dead end job with no potential and it is depressing being there for 9 hours a day. Thats why I am on here instead of working.\n",
      "Yeah the burn out isn't the worst I experienced. I previously worked jobs that I was at for 12 hours a day but they were more rewarding.\n",
      "I am there for 9 hours. I probably only work for 1 hour a day. The rest of the time I am killing time.\n",
      "No. I have no energy to find a new job. Also given the pandemic, keeping a secure paying job is more important than happiness. \n",
      "Yes you hit the nail on the head. In a rut for sure. \n",
      "It is very tough to express feelings.\n",
      "No. It has been suggested to me before. While I understand the benefits, it is something that I don't feel like doing. \n",
      "That's a good point about recognizing patterns.\n",
      "That is a good idea. I also see a psychologist and a psychiatrist for help. \n",
      "Thank you for taking the time to listen.\n",
      "You too. Have a nice day.\n",
      "Hey! I’ve been better. Just so stressed out! I don’t handle pressure well.\n",
      "That’s right. I have three final exams next week and I’ve had the flu so I haven’t been able to study at all.\n",
      "I’m sure I can figure something out. I’ll definitely have to study all weekend. I just really need to pass. Do you know any good tricks to help study?\n",
      "Thanks! Education is very important in my family. My dad was a teacher so I’ve always had to live up to high expectations.\n",
      "I love that idea! I think I’ll feel much better if I take that time to just relax before I really start working.\n",
      "Whoever said that sure knew what they were talking about. It’s so true!\n",
      "Any snack recommendations? I’ve got some fruit on hand, but it’s a little boring by itself lol\n",
      "I don’t think I’ve ever tried banana chips! I’ll have to see if my grocery store has got them. Maybe I can get some delivered by the time I’m ready to study\n",
      "Thanks so much! I’ve added them and some of my favorite trail mix to my cart. Should be delivered in 1 hour!\n",
      "I am feeling better. Thanks so much for the advice :)\n",
      "Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day!\n",
      "I'm in depression because recently i lost my job\n",
      "yes up to five years but my company getting too much lost so they took out lots of employs \n",

      "\n",
      "Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts\n",
      " just come so fast\n",
      "tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing \n",
      "I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate\n",
      "\n",
      "i pretty much have to do it constantly\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part\n",
      "\n",
      "right. I will try and start that more today and commit to it\n",
      "\n",
      "yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized\n",
      "\n",
      "yes. do you meditate?\n",
      "'\n",
      "do you want to keep talking or should we wrap up? i could go either way\n",

      "only sport seems to make me happy but the pandemic is not helping me with that\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes but it didn't work out as most jobs need job experience and I only have a small amount of that\n",
      "It's hard to get a job these days, I was thinking of doing entrepreneurs work\n",
      "But now i guess I have to get through school first before I think about that\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, thats a good idea, but i don't think I will do well because school is also stressing me out a lot\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah. thanks i hope I can and I will try and I do enjoy the college course I do but it is very hard\n",

      "Got any advice for a lonely single fellow in his mid thirties? I miss my friends, and virtual meetings on Zoom don't feel the same as meeting in person!\n",
      "Well, I've been writing enough poetry to publish a book, so I'll certainly do that. I know the pandemic has been rough for everyone. Hopefully my doctor will say I qualify for the vaccine soon. \n",
      "Getting my stimulus check in the next week or so would certainly make me a bit happier, too. \n",
      "Oh, I took advantage of virtual yoga and zumba early on during the pandemic. Friends had virtual classes. Eventually they were able to go back to work. Being disabled is a poverty trap for a lot of people, not just me. I really want to find a girlfriend once I get vaccinated. \n",
      "Well, certain things don't work for every person. \n",
      "Technically, no, I don't HAVE to wait to get vaccinated, but then again, maybe I don't want a girlfriend. The only one I had ten years ago in college wanted to marry me and have a child and I wasn't ready for commitment. I fear marriage, actually. \n",
      "That's a good point, I'm sure if my poetry is entertaining or full of truth about my experiences in a wheelchair, perhaps a woman will find that attractive \n",
      "Or I could just get an adult entertainer to be my companion for a day. I've done that before with women in that industry. It costs a bit, but it's worth it for companionship \n",
      "\n",
      "No, I just hate the idea of waking up to one woman for 20 or 30 years\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's better than being alone\n",
      "\n",

      "It's ironic and strange how many people struggle with that stupid voice in their head that tells them they're not good enough to accomplish anything. \n",
      "Well of course it's consentual. I would never NOT ask for permission to do things with a sex worker, or any person. \n",

      "I did baby him, he can go outside through the dggie door.  He gets fresh fruit, spaghettie,  He has his own Alexa.\n",
      "If he died it would be OK, I would mourn him and move on.  But I have never had to give up a pet before.  I just think most people. wont take care of him like I do. Because he is still alive, I will worry about him\n",

      "Well I recently lost my grandfather and since then I have been feeling I am not doing well in life and that it's pointless. \n",
      "Yes I am. I\n",
      "I have talked to my family and my husband. They have helped some. I just feel depressed because I feel like I a not making an impact with my life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. That is true. \n",

      "\n",
      "No i have not. I am kind of a wired person and think I would struggle to meditate. \n",

      "Hi, I am in a town all alone and far from family. I have been really depressed.\n",
      "Yes, I moved away and I thought I would be happier on my own but now all I do is think about them and miss them. Nobody ever has time to talk on the phone so I am all alone.\n",
      "No, I was living with my mom and dad but when I moved out my brother got my room. He and I didnt get along so he would never want me to move back into the house with them either.\n",
      "That is a good idea, I can reach out to my mom. Maybe I should write her an email or something?My brother was a bully and so he is a big reason that I moved. My parents encouraged us to fight and argue, it wasn't a very fun place to live.\n",
      "I've always been closer to my mom so she is much more understanding. She helps me pay my monthly bills too.\n",
      "Yes, that is a good point. I have always heard the blood is thicker than water.\n",
      "I have also been upset lately because I had to leave all my pets when I moved out. I left my dog and my cat back at home.\n",
      "No, I am too far away to stop by or go for the weekend. I would have to plan a whole trip and I cant really afford it yet. My brother knew that the pets were mine but he demanded that he keep them there and I didnt want to fight with him so I said fine.\n",
      "Yeah, you are right. Once he let the gate open just so my dog would run away, he says he didn't do it but I know him and he is really mean and vengeful. He would also pull pranks on me that were just cruel. He once told me that my cat was ran over but he was just hiding her at a friends house for a week.\n",
      "Yeah, I used to be really depressed living there. I haven't thought about why I moved but you are helping me remember that i'm better off now. I am lonely but so much happier not living in the turmoil over there.\n",
      "Yep, I am feeling better today . Thank you for listening. Maybe I should just get a new rescue dog or something like that today? I don't want to dwell on my brother or that negativity. I am feeling a lot more hopeful just sharing my feelings.\n",
      "Thanks! Have a great day too!\n",

      "I'm trying. I'm not saying anything negative even though that's just my NY personality. She doesn't have a sense of humor though.\n",
      "I think she just wants to live alone here and wallow in her misery and embarrassing TV choices. lol But yes, you're right, I'm just trying to make her comfortable. And yes, we have nothing in common.\n",
      "I may buy a car to live in. But I'm in AZ and it's about to be 110 degrees every day...\n",
      "She screamed at me one day about 2 weeks ago, but hasn't mentioned it since. But, I do know she still wants me to go...the problem is if I bring it up, she gets really angry. It's like I can't win.\n",
      "I think she thinks when I try to talk about it, it means I want to leave and since there's nothing either of us can do about it, she hates me even more...because it implies I can't stand her. If that makes any sense. \n",
      "She's extremely non-confrontational. (except for that one day where she just let it all out--hates my personality apparently)\n",
      "But I don't want to make her mad again. Sometimes she just forgets things. lol Maybe she'll forget that she wants me to leave.\n",
      "The funny thing is, she just bought a trailer....and I offered to live in it. She didn't go for that idea. \n",
      "She bought it as a horse trailer. So she can both live in it when she goes on the rode and carry her horses too. But she hasn't even used it since she bought it months ago. Do you know how long we're supposed to chat for btw? \n",
      "road*, not rode. lol sorry\n",
      "Ah, 15 minutes...I see it says on the left. \n",
      "Oh good, I think we've done that? I tried this study before but don't know if I got paid...don't think so.\n",

      "\n",
      "That would be good, but I am not the best at it. Just recreationally. It would also require school which is out of the picture right now\n",
      "That is true. I will look in to it. Maybe I could do my own thing too with organization. I am also moving at the moment, plus the pandemic so there are a lot of stressors.\n",
      "Yes good idea. I will work on that, making a list of what I would like to do and strengths. Just brainstorming. It takes a long time to figure it out and do the hiring process, or possibly going to school. It is a big decision\n",
      "Thank you! You have been helpful and motivating\n",

      "Yes. I have submitted hundreds of applications and I don't even receive an email on most of them.\n",
      "I've asked a few, but most of the people I know work retail jobs. I make more money than that working online. I just want a normal adult job, you know? I went to college, so it shouldn't be that hard.\n",
      "I like museum jobs or jobs that work with animals, but all of those require years of experience that I can't get because no one will hire me\n",
      "That is true. Maybe it just isn't the right time. Maybe I need to learn something before I find a job that I need to do\n",

      "I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn't want me back.\n",
      "That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it's too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg?\n",
      "I haven't really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. \n",
      "Yeah, that's true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don't want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together.\n",
      "I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way  I could use to get him to want me again?\n",
      "I can understand what you mean. I need to think this through.\n",
      "Well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. I liked being with someone so popular. He wasn't always nice to me and is why I wanted to be with someone else for a short time. He used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes.\n",
      "My friends always said that I could do better and that he didn't deserve me. He gave me statis in our town and everyone wanted to be his girlfriend so I think I liked the attention, yes.\n",
      "I really liked being with the popular guy who everyone looked up to. My parents don't like him at all and have wanted us to break up the whole time we were together.\n",
      "I have never thought of it this way. You are making a lot of good points that I never thought of before. When I think about him I miss the way I felt in terms of being popular. I don't really miss him as a person.\n",
      "HI\n",
      "Anyone there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Is anyone there?\n",

      "My boyfriend just stopped communicating with me. It's like he lost interest in me and moved on.\n",
      "Breakups are the worse around the holidays. It was around Thanksgiving last year. Have you ever been through a breakup during the holidays?\n",
      "I tried to call, text, and email him but he never responded. I just accepted it as he just moved on, and I had to do the same. \n",
      "I am sorry to hear about your girlfriend. That must have been hard to experience your breakup on your birthday.\n",
      "No, he just totally cut off all communication. I don't know whether or not he is safe or anything. \n",
      "We never went out on a date or anything. It was just strictly communicating my phone, text, and email. It was kind of weird, like he was hiding something. I don't know about any of his friends or family. He does not have any social media accounts. \n",
      "It was more of a long distance relationship. It is far to love from a distance though.\n",
      "It is hard to love from a distance-- sorry.\n",
      "Yes. It was nice talking to you. I am about to sign off. Have a great day!\n",

I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood.\n",
      "\n",

I believe there are three things in my favor:  I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current (related) job fifteen years ago.\n",

      "\n",
      "Because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that I get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes.  It would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along.\n",

      "The music events year round are outstanding.  They have many well known names in Christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing.  To be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless.\n",

This one is for the books, and something I have never encountered in my 10 years of working. \n",

I try to tell friends and family that I cannot always be the problem solver, I try to make them see that I deserve a chance to ask advice, to just vent, or to just have a light talk about the weather or a party or something.

      "Yes. It does hurt. I want to get better at picking clothes that make me happy. A lot of my clothes are baggy. Maybe I could learn to sew and alter them.\n",
      "I have had that same exact problem! When I wear clothes that fit nicely, I do get complements. I think I will go through my wardrobe and find the best clothes I have and wear those. \n",

      "Yeah, he says the same kind of thing, that I need to be firmer and just leave when I'm due to. I guess the only way for them to truely see is for the work to just not get done as there's no time!\n",

      "I've tried to bring it up with her indirectly, but it's an uncomfortable issue, you know? She is really upset, and I don't know whether it's my place to handle this kind of thing. It's more of an HR issue, but should I go to HR? Will that help, or just get me in trouble? I don't know.\n",
      "No, the company hasn't set up a system for passing along info that way. I don't know if she has talked to HR. She might not have because she's worried that it'll get back to her boss, and she'll get punished. I'd like to be supportive, even if I can't help solve the problem.\n",
      "Thanks for your words of encouragement? Maybe there is little I can do, but I don't want to let the problem fester. She's a great co-worker and a great worker. We need her on the team. What do you think a good first step would be?\n",
      "Sometimes we have lunch, but usually she just eats at her desk. I could easily send her texts of encouragement.\n",
      "Ok. I'll try sending a couple of texts every day. Then I'll see if she wants to have lunch outside with me when the weather gets better. \n",
      "Thanks. The boss is pretty good at his job. He know how to manage projects and he's good with clients. There is just this one thing that he gets wrong and somebody needs to get him to stop.\n",
      "Thanks. I guess I just have to accept things as they are. I can't afford to leave this job, and it's impossible to find another job at this time. Plus I don't want to abandon my co-worker in her time of need.\n",
      "True. I hadn't thought of it that way. I should consider my needs. Thanks!\n",

      "Thank you! A long time ago his sister told me that he cheated on me and I believed her and so I wanted to get him back.\n",
      "I appreciate that and have been thinking about character a lot lately. I do believe he cheated on me first, if that even matters now.\n",
      "Yes, I feel very even! I won't do it again. Can I ever give up the guilt that I feel and move on in our relationship or do I have to tell him what I did? I have known couples who don't tell each other and they are happy now.\n",
      "Thank you for making me feel heard. I have been alone in my thoughts and needed to be understood. Yes, I agree with you and I feel like I kind of let it go now that I told you about it.\n",

      "Maybe I should have done more to show her that I cared for her. Am I not romantic enough? Some guys just aren't that way.\n",
      "That's a fair point. I shouldn't be too hard on myself.  I didn't really grow up in a romantic family. I don't know how to do that stuff, but maybe I could learn.\n",
      "That's true. I really got hung up on her. I thought she was perfect and that we were perfect together. She didn't see it that way. I can't really change who I am, and she couldn't change who she is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if I can change myself for her. Maybe there is something basic that she wants that I just don't have? I should probably change for future relationships. \n",

      "I agree with you. Do you think that I should try calling his friends and asking for his new number? \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I can see your point of view. I have been obsessed with our relationship. We had a fight and it was a verbal war between us and he wouldn't forgive me afterwards.\n",
      "It is true and I am a really nice person and have turned down other guys for him. I am going to stop thinking about him and just join the gym today. You have opened my eyes!\n",
      "It's a pretty day, but I'm sad.  How are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't like being blamed for something when I don't feel I did anything wrong.  A neighbor's dog attacked my dog and another dog within a week and I reported it to our apartment manager and animal control.  She was given the choice to get rid of her dog or move and she decided to move.  But my neighbors are mad at me, because they think I overreacted.  I guess they liked her more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely!  You nailed it!\n",

      " \n",
      "Sounds like we live in the same neighborhood!  Ha!\n",
      "Yep!  That's how I feel.  What should I do to get back in good graces with them?\n",
      "I totally agree with you!  The woman is disabled and I think most of the neighbors feel sorry for her.  I've seen her loose control of the dog before, but she never attacked another dog(s).  I've even seem the dog pull her scooter over and the woman needed lots of help to get back into it.  I think everyone feels sorry for her.\n",
      " \n",
      "I've talked to the neighbors face-to-face and they just think that I overreacted.  The woman started getting her dog and private training and so they feel that she was trying.  My point was that my dog weighs 15 pounds and her dog weighs 45 pounds and, if it happens again, I may not have a dog anymore.  I don't want to wait until a dog is killed or badly injured.  I told them exactly what you just said, but they are being mean!\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess I could try talking to them again.  Maybe they've cooled off some.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much!  Those are really good suggestions.  I'll do that and, hopefully, they will calm down.  If not, I have other friends that live outside my neighborhood.  And I can talk to the manager like you said.\n",

      "Yes trying to get over the passing of my aunt a week ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, it is actually a week today.  My mother has taken it particularly hard, they were best friends\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks.  I really have not had much time to grieve myself since she is my first priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any suggestions what I might try to cheer her up?  After that I can worry about myself\n",
      "\n",
      "That might be ok.  I know she likes Neil Diamond.  Maybe get some of that playing while she meditates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now what should I do for myself after she is better?\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought about trying some daily exercise like just walking around the block a couple times with my dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought about redecorating her house a little bit, they lived together for a long time maybe a change of scenery would do some good\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, well thanks for your help\n",
      "\n",
      "I think when I start eating a little better things will improve too.\n",

      "Ok good idea,  Thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "Not too great, honestly. \n",
      "I am struggling to keep up with all of the assignments in my classes and I am anxious that I am going to fail some of them. \n",
      "It really is hard to manage\n",
      "Three of them were required for majors in my year, unfortunately. \n",
      "I have a couple friends in the same classes but there is so much material it is hard to find any time to get together. \n",
      "That sounds like a great idea but I am not sure if they will have any sympathy for me. \n",
      "You're right. I guess it would be worth the time and effort to at least ask. That is probably better than just suffering. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't really have much of a support system. I really am just trying to self motivate.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",

      "because I didn't trust him and I was always jelous\n",
      "Yes, I think so, because I should not feel like that, I should trust him\n",
      "Yes, it's true. Thanks for the information\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm trying not to talk to him or think about him, because I feel better\n",

      "Hello...\n",
      "I am quite stressed.\n",
      "I can't believe that my hours were cut again at my current job. \n",
      "Because of the pandemic, my boss is not generating enough money so they cut everyone's hours. I don't blame him but I am so frustrated at this whole thing. \n",
      "I want to but I don't want to be fired or annoy them. \n",
      "I just don't want to annoy them. Meanwhile, I am trying to get another job but no luck so far. :(\n",
      "Yep and unfortunately I still have not receive any response. \n",
      "No one in the neighborhood has kids and everyone does their own yard work around my area.\n",
      "At this point, I don't know. I have thought about doing art commissions and selling them online but I don't know if my abilities are enough. Plus there is a lot of completion in the field. \n",
      "You know what? I think I'll try it out. :)\n",
      "I think that is it. Thank you for the encouragement. :) \n",
      "You too!  :)\n",
      "I am having a hard time with the realization that my once strong friendships are no longer as strong. I feel disconnected with them. The limitations the pandemic has set for all of us have been great. I am unsure if I will ever regain those friendships \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I have tried to message them daily, but the responses have always been clipped and or the response comes after couple days. I do feel other friendships have formed within each community, feeling a bit left out. I feel silly, like a teenage girl, who wants to be included. Just want to feel as though I am still part of their lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was thinking the same thing, but I am unsure I feel awkward now, I feel like I do not them as I thought I did. I am unsure why I feel this way. one of them is my daughters god mother and the text are there but they are not like they use.. I am unsure if I should ask why she has time for others and not us... just saying it makes me feel weird\n",
      "\n",
      "anyone there?\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with you, just seems really strange since we were inseparable before the pandemic. I am also aware many are going through this situation just thought my friendships were stronger and distant would not be an issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will, never did I think I would hesitate whats going on.. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I have. The conversation have been superficial, like small talk. There is nothing to share, I am guessing. My daughter has had lots of dance functions despite the pandemic and yet I have not felt supported. Perhaps shes not okay with venturing out during the pandemic.. though I do see on social media shes meeting other friends in social settings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I need to be more open and not be so distant? Maybe its me and I am not seeing it?\n",
      "\n",
      "we are both 35 and we met in pre K. we are lifetime friends. shes a sister to me. At some point our parents use to live in the same apartment complex, our parents are great friends as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was there for her babies birth, when she found out what she was having. We have shared grand moments together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, shes the serious one and I am the loud and carefree one. So having our roles a bit reverse has me a bit, weirded out. I am an only child, and perhaps that makes me feel extremely unconfident. I am sure if asked, she would respond I am just being needy. eh, I will ask, since the pandemic ive only seen her once. \n",
      "\n",
      "You are right! thank you for the reinsurance. I hate that I am this way. \n",
      "\n",
      "you have helped me so much today, thank you for helping see things differently. \n",
      "\n",
      "AWESOME! then you know the overwhelming need (sometimes) of being included. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I have a plan, lunch and talk to her about how I am feeling, shes always been so understanding, I miss her babies so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I do , thank you! have a wonderful weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "i'm kind of tired, you?\n",

      "\n",
      "yea, and almost done with school but depression kept me from pulling myself out of bed to get an internship so I messed up\n",
      "yea but I feel like a failure because I see people younger than me there also and demotivates me further\n",
      "\n",
      "thanks, I wouldn't be so hard on myself if I had more support from my parents also\n",
      "yea but they don't really care because they are more focused on fighting with each other and working\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a friend who i talk to but I feel bad imposing so much\n",
      "\n",
      "yea I do, they also had their own issues so they understand me sometimes but it does help to vent sometimes\n",
      "\n",
      "yea I did that and it helped me cope a lot better since I don't hurt myself anymore at least\n",
      "\n",
      "yea! also thank you very much for letting me vent it does help a lot\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much for listening and hope you have a good day! \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "Oh, I'm okay. I'm just tired of everything and it has me down.\n",
      "Just life in general, I guess. I'm tired of covid. I'm tired of worrying about my mom and not going out and everything\n",
      "She's high risk, so we have to be careful who we come in contact with. We try to limit time in public and all that. I order groceries for pickup at walmart so i dont have to go in, and my schooling is all online so i dont have to go to class. \n",
      "She's been fighting cancer. She's in remission now, but her immune system is still compromised and we have to be even more careful than we usually would have to be\n",
      "Yeah, we text and have group chats and stuff, and we snapchat a lot. It's been a while since I saw any of them, though. At least we have that, though.\n",
      "And yeah, it's really stressful worrying about her. And she feels so bad because I can't see my friends or go in the store or to school\n",
      "Yeah, it does. I don't need a lot of in-person interaction. I'm an introvert, so this was all just fine when it started. But even introverts need to be around people sometimes.\n",
      "Yes, it does seem like the cycle of guilt.... I try not to let her see how much this is affecting me, but she's my mom and she can tell... \n",
      "Yeah, I'm pretty good at self-analysis lol\n",
      "Oh that's a really good idea! That might be something we can do. It won't be quite the same, but it's better than nothing. I'll ask my mom's doctor if that will be okay.\n",
      "Thank you. Hopefully it will, and hopefully she will be able to get the vaccine soon, too. \n",
      "You too!\n",
      "Thank you for listening to me today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am nervous about receiving another pay cut and reduced hours. I dont think I can handle it financially, the fear is real.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, specially with the disastrous winter storm I underwent. Makes me nervous if our state decides to shut down to combat the pandemic. I am unsure as to what to do\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe its more of a general sense of anxiety. I had to take a 25% pay cut with reduced hours, it was a complete lifestyle change. Not only for myself but for my children\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I could not agree with you more. Specially now that I have tapped into my savings and retirement. Never in life did I think I would worry about paying my light bill. \n",
      "Thank you for the kind words. I have control of some aspects. Perhaps I will apply for an additional job, just to ensure I have a steady income. Thank you for the guidance. If you dont have any other advice we can end our interchange after this reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, I will keep that in mind. \n",
      "No, not today I feel a lot more calm and gained a better understanding of my emotions and the situation I am finding myself in. \n",
      "\n",
      "Same to you, thank you for understanding and offering really good advice, i am guessing I had forgotten that there are things I can control \n",
      "\n",
      "I am unsure how to end our chat\n",
      "\n",
      "No, thank you for putting everything in perspective for me. goodbye.\n",
      "Hi, I'm having trouble with this distance learning. It seems more difficult than in-class learning. Most of my teachers just post lessons on the classroom website, and there's not a lot of guided instruction. My grades are slipping. I'm used to getting mostly A's, and now I'm mainly making Cs. It has me really anxious.\n",
      "Yes, I'm so tired of it! I never thought I'd say this, but I'm ready to go back to school!\n",
      "We aren't doing in-class learning. My mom is high-risk so I'm not attending to minimize possible exposure. The option is there, but if you can't because of health reasons, they let you stay home and do online learning all week. For my mom's sake, that's what I'm doing.\n",
      "Hopefully she can get the vaccine soon. She's afraid of it because it's new, but she knows she has to get it. \n",
      "She's been talking to her doctor about setting up an appointment. I've heard the second dose can make you feel pretty gross, so that's what I'm worried about. I hope it doesn't affect her too bad.\n",
      "Oh that's great! Does it hurt? I know I should get it eventually but I'm low on the priority list cuz I'm healthy. But I'm afraid to get it because I'm terrified of needles lol\n",
      "Thank you, you're too kind\n",
      "Oh, good. That does make me feel better. Thank you for that.\n",
      "I hope once she's able to be vaccinated, I'll be able to get back in the classroom for learning. Then maybe my grades will improve\n",
      "Covid has had me very anxious the past year. School hasn't been as easy as it used to be, and I've been worried about my mom getting it.\n",
      "Thank you for saying that. This has made me feel much better. \n",
      "I'm scared about my future\n",
      "I got fired because of Covid, and I don't know how I'll be able to find a job and have an income.\n",
      "Yes that is correct, and with the job market, how am I supposed to find a secured job.\n",
      "That is true, I just have to work hard for myself. I am learning valuable lessons like the idea that companies don't care about their workers, etc. Working more on myself sounds like the better option.\n",
      "Thank you for all that you've done today, I couldn't get through it without you dude.\n",
      "Thank you for your time today, hearing my concerns about the future!\n",
      "I'll continue to keep on the lookout for new job opportunities, as well as improving myself for the long term. I appreciate it!\n",
      "I could definitely reduce my spending like going out less for fast food, cutting my Netflix and Hulu subscriptions, and prepare my own meals for the next week weeks, as I try to find a new job. This would definitely help with my concerns about income and financial security.\n",
      "Very true, people definitely need to find their fitting for when things go wrong. Failure or bad events give us time to think about the important things in life, as well as our true needs.\n",
      "Thank you, this has really helped me overcome my anxiety and fears of the events from the past year!\n",
      "Thank you for your time, I'll have to be leaving now, this will help me for sure!\n",
      "i am extremely stressed outat work\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "absolutely! Too many people are of a furlough scheme, but the work load is still the same ! it is absolutely manic ! i am working 4 departments at once \n",
      "\n",
      "My boss believes that I should just take the workload as it is. I dont know what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope so, I am very scared to lose my job, as my boss says I am not capable to do my work if i get stressed out so easily\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think I am better off finding something else or at least try ?\n",
      "oh absolutely ! Do you think I should try out medication to help with stress?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will give this a go! Are there any home remedies I can try ? I can barely get hold of my doctors, it is so hard to get an appointment!\n",
      "sadly we are not alowed to go out in this pandemic , it is so hard to keep social .\n",

      "Hello, I've been really depressed lately and feel like there isn't anything I can do to break this feeling.\n",
      "November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS (its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family.\n",
      "Yes that is correct\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I'm not alone and that's what makes it hard to reach out, because I don't want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there's.  It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect.\n",
      "I just don't know what to do about it anymore\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I don't like to bother others or let other people down\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a lot, I'm used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself.  I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease.  I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it's not quite warn yet being in the northeast\n",
      "\n",
      "I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn't as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february\n",
      "\n",
      "The local FB group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else (seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently) but I've never heard of the app Neighbors, I'll have to look into that.\n",
      "I will definitely have to look into that\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting someone else's perspective helps because like you recommending that app, there are things I don't know about out there so I appreciate that.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you, but I feel like everyone says that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the main reason ive lost my friends is because I cant go out with them or hangout anymore because I have a baby. Im not fun anymore. I had my child young so I feel like I lost out on my youth\n",

      "Yes, thats right. But Im having trouble accepting the fact that I have to do this alone. \n",

      "Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking.\n",
      "Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I'm drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just  don't like not remembering things.\n",
      "I used to black out a lot, but I have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks I consumed in half, if I do choose to go out.\n",
      "It is typically the amount I'm drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "They don't necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but I do have to tell them I'm not gonna go out for the night. \n",

      "Hmm...That doesn't seem like a bad idea. I am just worry that my parents will not be very understanding. My parents are too strict and they don't like to hear any complaints or excuses.\n",

There are times that I am talking with her and she has droopy sleepy eyes and kinda nods off.  I have comfronted her but she denies any drug use and gets mad and says this is why addicts go back because they get acussed even when they arent using.  Any advise on what I should do?  Should I just leave it alone and home that she is getting the help she needs?  She has 3 kids too. \n",
      "yes that is correct.  I worry about her and her kids, but I am not sure if she is clean or not. \n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I thought so too!  He knew I'd be upset and he didn't want to deal with me I guess.  He knew I wanted to get married some day from the very start.  He knew it didn't have to be soon.  I'm still in college.  I just want to know that he wants marriage some day but he decided that marriage is an institution he doesn't believe in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, It was completely unexpected because things with us were going great.  I was completely blindsided.  We hadn't even talked about marriage lately.  He just knew that it was something that I wanted in the future.\n",

      "because lots of people in my office they lost their job\n",
      "because of this job crises situation of covid\n",
      "how is your situation?\n",
      "yes all effect because of this Covid\n",
      "yes I'm also trying to come out from this situation\n",
      "no i'm trying to talk but i couldn't \n",
      "I'm just thinking but i couldn't i don't no why\n",
      "I think because i have fear of  maybe i lost my job that's why\n",
      "yes \n",
      "Thank you for thinking that much for me\n",
      "yes , Thank you for your support\n",
      "Thanks, bye\n",
      "Hi, I'm feeling pretty lonely today and don't have friends I can reach out to.\n",
      "I have my husband, but with COVID he's the only person I've really had interactions with lately.  He's great, but it's just not the same as having a friend to turn to.  I feel every time I reach out to the friends I do have they are too busy with their families to talk.\n",
      "Yea, I do comment on their social media and follow up with their lives there.  I do not actively post about my own life because we have been extremely cautious with covid as I am high risk, so we don't even go grocery shopping.  I think I am just feeling fatigued of being stuck inside, which makes me feel sad about everything else.\n",
      "Yes, I am awaiting my turn for the vaccine and I am very much looking forward to getting it so I can get back to some normalcy.  I miss being able to go shopping or sitting in a coffee shop.  These activities helped me in the past, so I look forward to being able to get out and do them again.  I used to visit my friends too and we'd have lunch or coffee at their house, but obviously I haven't been able to do that lately.  I will be able to once I get the vaccine.\n",
      "That's so exciting for you!  I am hoping I will be able to get mine in the coming weeks.  I've definitely been looking forward to getting it.  I decided a week ago that I would get a puppy as a companion.  So I am looking forward to that, but he will not be coming home until the beginning of May.  But you're right I need to look forward to the things that will bring me happiness even though it's hard right now.\n",
      "I love walking outside.  We had a 60 degree day not too long ago and I went outside immediately to walk.  My mood was better that day than it has been in months.  I am definitely looking forward to spring, which is quickly approaching now!  I have to say, I appreciate you pushing me in the direction of thinking positively and looking forward to the future, it's something I definitely lost my grasp on for a little while.\n",
      "You're definitely right I have a lot to be excited about.  I like the idea of setting goals each day.  Now that the weather is slightly nicer I think going for a daily walk is a good idea.  Also, definitely preparing for puppy and getting an area set up and arranged for him is a great idea.  I find myself mindlessly scrolling the internet many days so reading a book is also a great idea.\n",
      "That's a good point, maybe an e-mail as that is something they may check when they have some down time, where as when I text I feel a lot of times they look at it and are busy and then forget to respond.  But if they sit down and are checking their emails maybe they will have time for a quick response.\n",
      "I think they probably are, most of them have quite young children and it's been hard not being able to connect with their family or have play dates for their kids for much of the year.  I hope we can all gather again soon.  It seems like things are moving in the right direction finally.\n",
      "Yea that had to be tough on the kids in school.  And the teachers.  I can't imagine being a kid in school going through all of this.  I just want to say thank you so much for all of your help today and really giving me a push in the right direction.  I'm not sure if it was just getting to chat with someone other than my husband or the advice you gave, but I am feeling more positive.\n",
      "Thanks and I hope you have a good day :)\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a fantastic experience. we were together for 3 years. I am not mad at him, he's a good guy. He was separated when we met. But as all life, it's complicated\n",
      "Yes, I had my eyes wide open during the process and he and I were very open with our communication. I can see lots of blessings but I am just so sad. Each day is a challenge to focus \n",
      "I can't imagine a relationship right now\n",

      "\n",
      "During this time with the affair, I had the strength to leave a narcissistic spouse that abused me emotionally. I am proud of myself for that. \n",
      "\n",
      "It has been. You are right about me focusing on solo time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for letting me talk about this. It is a touchy topic, affairs. My heart was so loved during that time but I always told him that if he needed me to step back, I would. It has been difficult on both of us.\n",
      "Being a parent, having the families meshed together, homes, work, etc.... I can understand why he feels he should try again.\n",
      "thank you so much for saying that. It really means a lot to me and grounds me\n",
      "\n",
      "you are correct, that I need to move forward for me. I deserve it. That's a concept I have been learning.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Yeah that makes sense. It's just hard you know. What steps should I take to feel better?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay I'll try to make an effort to go out more.\n",

      "Hi there. I don't really know how to start with this, but I've been feeling low for the last year or so, and feel like my mood is getting worse with each day. I don't have any motivation to do anything and I'm not sure exactly where to turn. \n",
      "I think that might be true. Can you offer any advice or guidance on what I can do to improve it? \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah my issues have definitely been compounded by the crisis, and not being able to speak to my friends or family, or even my work colleagues now I work from home. I don't have health insurance unfortunately, otherwise I'd have gone down that route. \n",
      "7 cups, I haven't heard of that one. What do they do? \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely even this conversation is making me feel a little better. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay sure, so I could just go to my local pharmacy and pick up Vitamin D? Or is that prescribed by a doctor? \n",
      "\n",
      "Okay that's good to know you have first hand experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, what does that do? I havent heard of that supplement before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay that's useful. And there are no side effects to taking vitamin D, are there? I'll look into st john's wort. It seems as though there is loads of research to be done here - which is a little stressful! \n",
      "\n",
      "That's true, it's working towards an end goal of feeling like myself again. You are right. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for that, it makes a difference to hear some encouragement. \n",
      "I don't want to overwhealm myself, but I think I'll go grab a coffee and take a look into Vitamin D and St Johns Wort now. I like the idea of using supplements and seeing how they work for me before moving onto heavier antidepressants. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's true, I'm just hoping the end of the tunnel isn't too far away. Can't face another summer locked inside with nothing to do! \n",

      "Yes for sure. She has her job so it just would feel weird for me to be at home while she works. \n",
      "\n",
      "I never have thought about online work. That might be a good idea.\n",
      "That is a great idea. I am sure I can get references. My boss loves me.  He said he is looking to help me any way he can.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have a couple of coworkers that have been helpful, but we don't always work together. And their help isn't always the best, or the type of support I am looking for.\n",
      "Yeah, it has been very difficult. Do you have any reccomendations? Or what would you do in the situation?\n",
      "\n",
      "I generally do do that. Sometimes I get the help I need, others not so much. So i feel like im second guessing myself a lot, which puts me under a lot of stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think thats a good idea. I am concerned it may not work out. What would i do then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision making and the little details are where I am struggling. I've had adequate training, but i still feel as though I lack the expertise needed to do my job well. Someimtes I get the support I need, and other times i don't. I'm wondering what i should do in times where I am not getting the support I need if its not available.\n",
      "Yeah, you're right. I think it will just take time for me to get comfortable and gain confidence in my abilities.\n",
      "That is a great suggestion\n",
      "Yeah, youre right. It can just be tough at times. But i understand it will take time. Thank you for the advice. It really helped.\n",

      "I’m doing ok. Have been feeling a bit anxious about my job lately. \n",
      "I think it’s partially due to the pandemic. I am struggling progressing at my company and have been up for a raise for a year now that still hasn’t gone through. It’s making me feel like they don’t value me. \n",
      "Yeah exactly. I want to feel like I am an important member of the team and right now I’m not feeling that and it makes me feel like I don’t have a future with this career anymore. But now is not the time for a career change. \n",
      "I think that’s the part that gets me anxious. I don’t really know how to communicate this to my superiors. There isn’t a lot of open communication now that we all work from home. \n",
      "Maybe going to HR would be the smart move? They might have some resources on how to navigate relationships now that we aren’t in the office, right?\n",
      "I have started applying to other jobs, but I don’t have a lot of hope with that right now. Maybe it is better to looks at more options at my current job. Getting up the courage to speak out can be hard though!\n",
      "I think so! I have a cordial relationship with everyone, but I know my work speaks for itself. I think I need more confidence to ask for what I know I deserve. \n",
      "That’s a really good idea. I think much of the anxiety I have with work stems from self esteem issues. \n",
      "I think I’m much more open to trying counseling before I would venture to trying medication options. Practicing talking to people at work might really help me. \n",
      "I am trying to remain level-headed about this. I know this is within my control and I just need to muster up the courage to do something about this situation that has me feeling anxious and stressed!\n",

      "It doesn’t;t feel like it will pass.  It feels like it will only get worse. I don’t want to go to bed alone.  I won’t be able to sleep tonight.\n",
      "My family is out of town.  My friends were also his friends and he told lies about me so they wont talk to me.  I want to just get drunk and go to sleep.\n",

      "Do you think I should call him and ask him to come back? He took our dog.\n",
      "But I still love him.  He did sleep with my best friend, but he said it didn’t mean anything. I really miss him,\n",
      "Thanks.  You are right, I am too good for him.  I had a job and he doesn’t.\n",
      "Yeah, I need the dog.  He gave it to me as a puppy for my birthday.  I can’t believe he took it. \n",
      "But I am still having a hard time getting to sleep, I am so upset.  I have been crying for hours.\n",
      "Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.  A bubble bath and some warm coco.  That always make me feel better\n",

      "The problem is I just don't really know how to feel better.  I have much to be thankful for but don't seem to be able to really enjoy anything.\n",
      "That's what my husband keeps saying, too, but I just can't dredge up any enthusiasm for anything except I try to get out and walk because the fresh air is nice.  I also knit, which is what I've been doing while lying in bed.  But I can't think of the last time I really truly enjoyed myself.\n",
      "Yes, the idea of a trip is enticing to me and I really hope to go visit my aunt in Michigan, perhaps in April.  She is my mom's only sister and the only relative I have left from that generation and I love spending time with her.  That was a good suggestion and I'll try to look forward to that.\n",
      "You have good insight and you are right, I need to focus more on enjoying the time I have with the people that I love.  I'm also hoping some new meds will eventually help  Thank you for listening\n",
      "God's blessings to you and your family\n",

      "\n",

      " can do for your well being as well!\n",
      "Great!  I will definitely qualify if that's the case.  I would be able to pay rent if we get this check soon.  It's been so hard making ends meet.  Sometimes I get so overwhelmed I feel like I can't breathe.  Any tips for that?\n",
      "That's so kind of you to say.  I try to stay positive and be strong but I often feel like I'm failing.  It helps to hear words of support that I'm going to make it through this tough time.  I've never meditate before.  Do you listen to music or just silence.  I would love to give that a shot.  I try to take deep breaths.  Oftentimes it helps but only for a moment.  Maybe mediation could help me overall for longer periods of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's so true!  I'm going to write that down and post it on my fridge!  Those are the words I'm going to live by for the next while.  I'll look up some apps!  Thank you for being such a great listener and supporter.  I feel so much lighter and hopeful.  I can't believe how much this has helped me.  I look forward to chatting again soon.  Thank you so much!  You have no idea how grateful I am to you right now.  I won't give up!\n",

      "\n",
      "Yeah, but I really liked her a lot. I think that maybe we just needed more time. She didn't know me well enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks! I keep telling myself that, but I'm worried that the same thing will happen with the next girlfriend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder that too. Did I shut her out? Was she needing more from me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I could be more open? I'm not sure. After this experience, I really don't trust women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it is better to wait a bit. But I feel like I need to DO something to get better, not just wait around. \n",
      "In matters of the heart? No, I don't trust my mom. In matters of the kitchen, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "OH! Ok. I see what you are saying. I should be careful about generalization. That's a good point. One bad experience shouldn't color my view.\n",
      "\n",
      "True. But how do I learn to trust women without getting badly hurt again? \n",
      "Hm. So, Dr. Freud, tell me about your love life.... LOL. Just kidding. I feel ya. I want to learn trust, but I don't know when the right conditions will return.\n",
      "\n",
      "True. You make a lot of great points. I needed to get some perspective on this issue.\n",

      "So I don't know if you can see the topic of my problem like I can see on my screen?\n",
      "\n",
      "If not I'll explain\n",
      "\n",
      "So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \"It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special\n",
      " friend.\" \n",
      "So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like she's the type who would not back down\n",
      "\n",
      "and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way\n",
      "\n",
      "So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel? \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?\n",
      " \n",
      "But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this. \n",
      "And that's true. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for listening to my ranting. \n",
      "Aw thank you! You have a good one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm feeling really anxious these days. \tI'm finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don't think I can afford to. I need to get done with school.\n",
      "School was always hard. Now it's gotten harder. I think a lot of people are stressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last semester and this semester. It feels like a lot longer though. \n",
      "A balance in life. I spend so much time online. I'm always staring at a screen. I would like to get aware from the computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I can't wait for things to return to normal. Until then, I don't know what I can do to feel normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I haven't. I thought it wouldn't be the same as really hanging out. I don't drink. I do like to play board games though.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's true. I wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren't interested. It's not the same thing to play with strangers.\n",
      "That's great. I wish I had kept in touch with my friends from those days. I'm not really much for just socializing though. I like some kind of activity, like games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok. Not really sure how to form a group. I want to reach out, but so many people are flaky. They makes plans then bail at the last minute. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ok. Will do. I'll see what I can get done. Thanks for your help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a good day!\n",
      "Okay for the most I guess.\n",
      "I just wanted why people do not see to notice me or want to have a conversation with me.\n",
      "Typos, sorry.\n",
      "Some of my own family members actually, I get cut off or not heard at all.\n",
      "I share pics in an email or text and share things in person but no one seems that interested and yes I listen to them.\n",
      "Not really, I never made friends too easily.  Not seeing anyone in person because of the pandemic except a few family members.\n",
      "I see them about two times a month, I am their ride as they have no car. Mostly it is my sibling, you can never please me, I know he is the one with the issue but just wish he would listen better and not make harsh comments.\n",
      "Meant please him.\n",
      "It would not help, he would never go for that. Sometimes we do have a rare good talk. Just frustrated because I saw him today and he once again made some comments.\n",
      "Oh I am quite assertive but with family I do not want to cause any issues.\n",
      "Thanks anyway, you cannot change anyone but yourself. I will survive.\n",
      "In the past I was more invisble to others in general but that has improved as I will actually strike up a conversation. Just sometimes I feel unnoticed.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "You too, take care.\n",
      "Hi, how are you? I am dealing with a lot right now!\n",
      "\n",
      "My job is driving me nuts! I can't handle it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pressure has been building and building. They keep giving me more responsibility, but no more help! The pandemic has really made my job a lot harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to quit the job and get away from the pressure. I'm worried about my mental health and also about the risk of COVID.\n",
      "I think that's the problem! I'm TOO competent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the company wouldn't give me so much work if I were worse at my job. The reward for doing a good job is more work!\n",
      "\n",
      "I know, I know! But the anxiety is killing me! Every day at work is worse than the last!\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to quit. How do I find a balance? How do I manage my anxiety?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think the company wants to give me a promotion because that would cost them more money. Maybe another company would pay me better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never tried meditation. That's a good idea. Maybe some other people at the company would like to try it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's true. Meditation is a good way to get in contact with my emotions. It might help me not feel so isolated. \n",
      "Yeah. I *can* get through this, if I reach out to others at the company. Maybe not the managers, but the other employees certainly know what I'm going through.\n",
      "I feel the anxiety getting better. I know that others have tried meditation to deal with stress and anxiety. It's a good suggestion. Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm actually looking forward to work tomorrow! I bet that my co-workers will welcome the suggestion of meditation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will do! Have a good day.\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "\n",

      "well I am not doing any job just freelancing which is a stable and guarantee income\n",
      "Yes I am looking for one but so far not succeeded at all.\n",
      "I made my resume from a website called Novoresume and time to time I update my resume too.\n",
      "It looks pretty professional.\n",
      "What are the keywords? do you know about anything it? I do not email the PDF file but the word file so my resume do not get ignore by the software company is using.\n",
      "Do you think Covid-19 has anything to do with it?\n",
      "Okay but what are the keywords? Is it different for different business?\n",
      "Covid-19 cause problem for everyone I guess not only me.\n",
      "Okay but I do not think so keywords are the issue.\n",
      "I am not getting calls from HR deptartment.\n",
      "Covid situation is getting better now so maybe I get a call.\n",

      "Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast...then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. \n",
      "It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up\n",
      "Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes.\n",
      "We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened\n",
      "She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn't ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety\n",
      "I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her.\n",
      "I will definitely try to get over her using those techniques you just said.\n",
      "It's way harder to do than say though. No, this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me\n",
      "Maybe you're right! Just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent\n",
      "I will definitely try. I know it will be hard because I am upset still but sometimes I guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation\n",
      "Awww I hope so. Just like some people say...there are plenty of fish in the sea. Thank you for the advice. It was really helpful.\n",

      "\n",
      "That is a good idea. I want him to get back to being himself. He is like a different person right now. It's scary.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will try to help him, he just doesn't want to seem to talk to my anymore. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach it with him?\n",
      "That is a good approach. And you don't think I will further upset him?\n",

      "Oh, no. 1 person outright quit immediately. 1 other has retired already. 1 more I know is retiring by New Years. Others are more \"stuck\", as they just CAN'T afford to quit OR retire. So, yeah, us \"old folk\" are not \"happy campers\"\n",
